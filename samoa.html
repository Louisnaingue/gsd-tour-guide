                <p><strong>Greeting Word:</strong> Talofa</p>
                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 260,000 (Samoa ~200,000; American Samoa ~60,000)</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> About 2,600 miles (4,180 km) southwest of Hawaii</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> Samoa – 1,130 sq mi (2,930 km²); American Samoa – 77 sq mi (199 km²)</p>
                <p><strong>Known:</strong> The Heart of Polynesia</p>
                <br>
                <p class="parcenter">Because Samoa is in the center of the Polynesian triangle, it is referred to as “the Heart of Polynesia.”
                    Geographically speaking, there are, in fact, two Samoas. Samoa is an independent country of about 1,130 square
                    miles and includes the islands of Savai'i and Upolu. The other, American Samoa, is a territory of 77 square miles
                    administered by the United States government and includes the eastern islands, primarily Tutuila. The
                    population of Samoa is just under 200,000 and American Samoa has just under 60,000 people. Jacob Roggeveen,
                    a Dutch Explorer, is credited with its discovery in 1722.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Although Samoa is two separate countries, its people, language and culture are one. From 1900 until the First
                    World War, Western Samoa was a German territory. After World War I, it became a trust territory administered
                    for the United Nations by New Zealand. In 1962, Western Samoa became the first independent Polynesian
                    nation.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">The constitution of American Samoa defines the basic governmental and legal organization. It provides for
                    executive, legislative and judicial branches. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor head the executive branch
                    and the bicameral legislature is popularly elected.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Samoans are raised in villages, or nu'u, such as this one at the Polynesian Cultural Center. The courtyard found
                    in each village is called the malae and accommodates the traditional festivities and ceremonies of the village.
                    Each of the structures in a Samoan village serves a special purpose.</p>

                    Each of the structures in a Samoan village serves a special purpose.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Buildings in Samoa are usually rounded in shape with domed roofs. Posts are spaced evenly around each
                    structure with large supporting beams in the center. The Samoans favor round shaped roofs not only for their
                    beauty and symmetry, but also for practical purposes. The round shape allows the rain to quickly run off to the
                    ground with out any obstructions. The dome shaped structure are also durable and up keep is minimal, but
                    most importantly they keep the interior cool and breezy during hot, humid days. Samoa’s location near the
                    equator means the weather is often hot and humid, which is why you will notice that none of the buildings have
                    walls.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="parcenter">The breeze comes in off the ocean and helps to
                    cool the occupants. Woven coconut leaf
                    blinds, called pola, are attached to the beams
                    of the buildings which can be lowered during
                    strong winds, storms, or when privacy is
                    desired. Roofing materials come from the
                    leaves of the sugar cane plant, some of which
                    are grown here in our plantation. The leaves
                    are bundled together and cleverly attached in
                    rows, round and around, until the whole roof
                    is covered. A first time thatch job will last 10-
                    15 years without repairs – in the absence of
                    excessively strong winds.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In Samoa the kitchen was the man’s domain because the preparation and cooking of food was
                    considered a physically demanding job. The Samoan earth oven is a typical hot rock oven, which is laid
                    out above the ground. The oven utilizes round river or lava rocks that conduct heat extremely well.
                    Four logs are arranged in a square with rocks, and then a fire is built to heat the rocks. When the fire
                    has heated the rocks and they are white with ash, charcoal debris is pushed aside and the food is placed
                    on the heated rocks. Fire resistant leaves are used to protect the food so they are not burnt. The whole
                    oven is then covered with banana leaves and other insulating materials.
                </p>
                <p id="coconutprocess">Hunting, climbing coconut trees, husking, cracking and milking the
                    coconuts all required physical strength, and the young men of the
                    family show their respect to their parents, grandparents, and women
                    by performing these arduous tasks. The young men prepare the
                    food, and serve their grandparents and parents first. Then the
                    young children eat. Finally, the cooks eat. This service is part of the
                    Samoan Way of Life, or <strong>Fa’a Samoa</strong> , in which respect is taught at a
                    young age. Young men serve their parents and elders in the same
                    way their future children will serve them when they start their own
                    families.
                </p>
                <div class="image-left">
                    <img src="images/coconut.png" alt="">
                    <p>The coconut is one of the most important items in the life of
                        Samoans and other Polynesians. From the various parts of
                        the coconut tree materials for buildings, clothing, and food
                        preparation are obtained. The first step that must be done
                        to use the coconut is to climb the very high tree to get it.
                        Here in the Samoan village, you will be able to see how
                        skillful the young men are at climbing the coconut trees,
                        obtaining the coconuts, husking them and extracting its
                        inner flesh for cooking purposes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>Once husked using a very sharp stick, the actual nut itself
                    appears to have a face on one end. Each coconut appears to
                    have two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. To crack open a coconut, a Samoan uses a heavy object or stone
                    and hits the line that runs across the face. The clear liquid inside the coconut is the juice. Young coconuts
                    that have not begun to produce much inner flesh contain more juice than ripe coconuts. The coconut
                    juice obtained from the very young coconuts is a refreshing drink in Samoa.
                </p>
                <h4>How do the Samoans get coconut milk?</h4>
                <div class="image-left1">
                    <img src="images/coconut2.png" alt="">
                    <p>Inside
                        the coconut is the white meat that can be grated
                        and squeezed through a strainer made from
                        various wood fibers. The white liquid that falls
                        from the grated coconut is coconut milk and is
                        used in all types of Samoan cooking.

                    sleeping on, and rolled up and placed in the rafters each morning. The Fale Nonofo also serves as the

                <p>As you observe the inside of this building, notice the cultural craftsmanship achieved by skilled workers
                    under the supervision of the master builder. The master builder is responsible not only for the physical
                    details, but also for the artistry of the building. A building of this size usually takes about 6-8 weeks to
                    complete depending on the number of men working and their skill levels

                <p>FALE TALIMALO: Guest House and FALE FONO: Meeting House (Same building; different purposes)
                    Fale Talimalo means “a house to receive guests.” Not only pre-arranged guests are welcome to stay
                    here, but also a person or group passing by who needs a place to rest. When pre-arranged groups arrive,
                    the family (immediate or extended or the village) will prepare leis, food and special decorations. A
                    special welcome ceremony would be included if the guest is a high ranking chief.
                </p>
                <p>When unexpected guests arrive, the immediate family will quickly prepare food and water. Bedding is
                    provided if the stay is extended. After the guests are fed and have rested, the chief will inquire as to the
                    purpose of the unexpected visit and the intended length of stay. He will then offer any further assistance
                    as needed.
                </p>
                <p>When not being used to host visitors, this building is also used as the Fale Fono, meaning, “meeting
                    house.” As a Fale Fono, this building is to serve the chiefs of the village as a gathering place to discuss
                    the affairs of the village. The discussions include monitoring the performance of individual families, the
                    safety of all the villagers, each family beautifying their yards, planting food crops and raising meat
                    animals to encourage self-reliance and generally maintaining order in the village.
                </p>
                <p>The posts surrounding the structure have special significance in Samoa. During meetings and
                    ceremonies, participants sit with their backs to a post representing their rank, family, or home village.
                    Some posts are reserved for various people of prestigious rank. The post centered at the left half of the
                    entrance is for the highest-ranking person in the visiting party, usually a chief. The post immediately
                    opposite is for the highest-ranking person of the home village, again usually a chief. The posts on either
                    side of the main entrance post are for the chief’s spokesmen known as the talking chiefs. The next two
                    posts on the left are for other local talking chiefs. Other minor participants sit on mats spread around
                    the outside rim. An interesting custom in Samoa is the fourth post from the left, known as the stranger’s
                    post. If a stranger comes into a meeting unannounced and demands it, the post must be surrendered to
                    him. From the three posts in the middle any food to be served during the meeting is dispensed.
                </p>
                <p>The kava ceremony takes place in this building. Not only does it represent the highest form of welcome
                    to guests, it also represents a unity of purpose. The significance lies in each chief drinking from the
                    same coconut cup, representing a solemn commitment to ally himself with the consensus of the council.
                    It is a sign of loyalty and symbolizes the highest ideals of all participants and the village people they
                    represent.
                </p>
                <p>The floor of this building is typical of what is found in Samoa. River pebbles and stones are gathered
                    from the nearby rivers and streams and spread to cover the interior area. The rocks help keep the house
                    cool and dry. If water does seep in, it spreads out under the rocks rather than pooling into hard-to-clean
                    puddles. Mats are placed on top of the rocks to provide comfort. The thicker the layer of mats, the softer
                    the seating area.
                </p>
                <img class="image" src="images/tapa.png" alt="">
                <p>Fine mats, or ie toga, used for ceremonies in this building, require special weaving skills. The pandanus
                    leaves are cleaned, boiled, and bleached in the sun until the desired shade of whiteness is reached. The
                    leaves are then flattened and left to season for about a week. The weaver then takes a shell or possibly
                    the sharp, hard wing of a coconut beetle and cuts the leaves into fine strands for weaving. Some of the
                    mats are woven so fine that they have the appearance of expensive linen. After a mat is completed, it is
                    given a name and used as the traditional currency of Samoa. Mats are given as gifts at weddings,
                    funerals, the dedication of buildings, chiefly ceremonies, and other special occasions. It takes many

                <br>
                <p>Matai is the Samoan word for leader or chief. There are two types of matai in Samoa - the Ali’i and the
                    Tulafale. The Ali’i is the name of the highest title in a family. Those who hold an Ali’i title preside at
                    council meetings, oversee proceedings, make the final important decisions (after consulting with other
                    matai), and pass their instructions along in whispers to the High Talking Chiefs, or Tulafale, who are
                    the mouthpieces of the Ali’i. They are expected to be eloquent and skilled in the art of lauga (oration).
                    The Tulafale represent the Ali’i as his spokesperson. The political system of Samoa was much more
                    open than in any other Polynesian group in the Pacific. Rather than being solely hereditary, it is possible
                    for people to rise to chiefly status by virtue of his or her abilities, loyalty to the village, and the service
                    one provides to the families in the village. The title of chief is conferred upon any eligible member of
                    the group, including women, with the common consent of the village and the chief’s council. The chiefs
                    are responsible for the general welfare of the group.
                </p>
                <img class="image" src="images/chiefs.png" alt="">
                <p>The Maota Tofa is the Chief’s house. In Samoa, this building is usually elevated 5-8 feet signifying the
                    Chief’s prestige. A building of this size sometimes takes 3–4 months to build depending on the
                    manpower. The master builder, called the Tufuga, plans and instructs all workers of the measurements
                    of each beam and pole. He determines the fashion and the design of the sennit lashings, which hold all
                    joints in place. The way the beams are fastened together gives support to every 6--7 feet of the roof and
                    strengthens the roof against the strong winds and heavy rain. The large beams and the poles are cut
                    from the native trees of Samoa. The ifilele (Iron wood), koi (Mahogany), niu (Coconut), fau (Balsom).
                </p>
                <p>There are three main reasons why a chief would have a building as large and beautiful as this. (1) The
                    chief is a well-respected individual by his family and the community and the building represents their
                    support and goodwill. (2) His title is of a royal line, or it is the highest in the family, village or district,
                    which he represents. (3) It represents the wealth of a strong family group or unified collection of villages.
                </p>
                <p>The chief’s house was simply furnished. Because finely woven mats were exchanged as currency, the
                    more mats a chief possessed and displayed, the richer he was. They were important also as a method
                    of paying tribute at weddings, funerals, and other public events.
                </p>
                <p>Only the chief would sleep on a bed, which is made of mats stacked to a desired height. Pillows were
                    made of bamboo and actually supported the head at the back of the neck. Samoans believe that sleeping
                    on a hard surface will give you a strong and straight posture.

                <p>War clubs were favored in tribal wars because Samoans preferred hand-to-hand combat. Throwing
                    weapons was disdained because it was considered cowardly. The clubs displayed here are carved from
                    Hawaiian wood. Notice that the club heads are patterned after things found in nature like the pineapple
                    and the sea urchin. Today, war clubs are finished with a coat of varnish or lacquer to preserve it and
                    give it a shiny finish. Traditionally, they were rubbed with a cowry shell for a special gloss.

                <h2>Tatau: The Art of Tattooing</h2>
                <figure class="picheader">
                    <img src="images/tatau.png" alt="">

                <br>
                <p>Samoans have been practicing the art of tattooing for over 2000 years. Two Fijian women, Taema and
                    Tifaiga, introduced the practice of tattooing to Samoa. Today, Samoan males desiring chiefly status or
                    leadership roles are generally tattooed. Many other men acquire tattoos for their appeal as a mark of
                    adulthood, a symbol of cultural identity, a revival of an ancient craft, and an acceptable body decoration
                    of beauty.</p>
                <p>Before the arrival of missionaries, it was compulsory for all males to be tattooed. It was considered a
                    decorative art form, which visibly denoted rank and status. Young men were tattooed between the ages
                    of 14 and 18 when they had stopped growing so that the intricate designs would not stretch. Tattooing
                    extended from the hips down to the knees. Although there has been a revival of tattooing, it still does
                    not equal its former acceptance
                </p>
                <p id="terms">Tattooing is a painful process. The Samoan tattoo master creates the designs with a comb-like tattoo
                    instrument. The larger the comb, the greater the area on the skin is covered with fewer strokes. He
                    punctures the skin by tapping the instrument with a small mallet.
                </p>
                <p >Samoan women were also tattooed, but usually in lesser quantity.</p>
