                    <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 260,000 (Samoa ~200,000; American Samoa ~60,000)</p>
                    <p><strong>Location:</strong> About 2,600 miles (4,180 km) southwest of Hawaii</p>
                    <p><strong>Size:</strong> Samoa – 1,130 sq mi (2,930 km²); American Samoa – 77 sq mi (199 km²)</p>
                    <p><strong>Referred:</strong> The Heart of Polynesia</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="parcenter">Because Samoa is in the center of the Polynesian triangle, it is referred to as “the Heart of Polynesia.”
                        Geographically speaking, there are, in fact, two Samoas. Samoa is an independent country of about 1,130 square
                        miles and includes the islands of Savai'i and Upolu. The other, American Samoa, is a territory of 77 square miles
                        administered by the United States government and includes the eastern islands, primarily Tutuila. The
                        population of Samoa is just under 200,000 and American Samoa has just under 60,000 people. Jacob Roggeveen,
                        a Dutch Explorer, is credited with its discovery in 1722.</p>
                    <p class="parcenter">Although Samoa is two separate countries, its people, language and culture are one. From 1900 until the First
                        World War, Western Samoa was a German territory. After World War I, it became a trust territory administered
                        for the United Nations by New Zealand. In 1962, Western Samoa became the first independent Polynesian
                        nation.
                    </p>
                    <p class="parcenter">The constitution of American Samoa defines the basic governmental and legal organization. It provides for
                        executive, legislative and judicial branches. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor head the executive branch
                        and the bicameral legislature is popularly elected.</p>
                    <p class="parcenter">Samoans are raised in villages, or nu'u, such as this one at the Polynesian Cultural Center. The courtyard found
                        in each village is called the malae and accommodates the traditional festivities and ceremonies of the village.
                        Each of the structures in a Samoan village serves a special purpose.</p>

                        Each of the structures in a Samoan village serves a special purpose.</p>
                    <p class="parcenter">Buildings in Samoa are usually rounded in shape with domed roofs. Posts are spaced evenly around each
                        structure with large supporting beams in the center. The Samoans favor round shaped roofs not only for their
                        beauty and symmetry, but also for practical purposes. The round shape allows the rain to quickly run off to the
                        ground with out any obstructions. The dome shaped structure are also durable and up keep is minimal, but
                        most importantly they keep the interior cool and breezy during hot, humid days. Samoa’s location near the
                        equator means the weather is often hot and humid, which is why you will notice that none of the buildings have
                        walls.</p>

                    <p class="parcenter">The breeze comes in off the ocean and helps to
                        cool the occupants. Woven coconut leaf
                        blinds, called pola, are attached to the beams
                        of the buildings which can be lowered during
                        strong winds, storms, or when privacy is
                        desired. Roofing materials come from the
                        leaves of the sugar cane plant, some of which
                        are grown here in our plantation. The leaves
                        are bundled together and cleverly attached in
                        rows, round and around, until the whole roof
                        is covered. A first time thatch job will last 10-
                        15 years without repairs – in the absence of
                        excessively strong winds.</p>
