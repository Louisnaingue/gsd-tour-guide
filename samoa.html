                <p><strong>Greeting Word:</strong> Talofa</p>
                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 260,000 (Samoa ~200,000; American Samoa ~60,000)</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> About 2,600 miles (4,180 km) southwest of Hawaii</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> Samoa – 1,130 sq mi (2,930 km²); American Samoa – 77 sq mi (199 km²)</p>
                <p><strong>Referred:</strong> The Heart of Polynesia</p>
                <br>
                <p class="parcenter">Because Samoa is in the center of the Polynesian triangle, it is referred to as “the Heart of Polynesia.”
                    Geographically speaking, there are, in fact, two Samoas. Samoa is an independent country of about 1,130 square
                    miles and includes the islands of Savai'i and Upolu. The other, American Samoa, is a territory of 77 square miles
                    administered by the United States government and includes the eastern islands, primarily Tutuila. The
                    population of Samoa is just under 200,000 and American Samoa has just under 60,000 people. Jacob Roggeveen,
                    a Dutch Explorer, is credited with its discovery in 1722.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Although Samoa is two separate countries, its people, language and culture are one. From 1900 until the First
                    World War, Western Samoa was a German territory. After World War I, it became a trust territory administered
                    for the United Nations by New Zealand. In 1962, Western Samoa became the first independent Polynesian
                    nation.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">The constitution of American Samoa defines the basic governmental and legal organization. It provides for
                    executive, legislative and judicial branches. The Governor and Lieutenant Governor head the executive branch
                    and the bicameral legislature is popularly elected.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Samoans are raised in villages, or nu'u, such as this one at the Polynesian Cultural Center. The courtyard found
                    in each village is called the malae and accommodates the traditional festivities and ceremonies of the village.
                    Each of the structures in a Samoan village serves a special purpose.</p>

                    Each of the structures in a Samoan village serves a special purpose.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Buildings in Samoa are usually rounded in shape with domed roofs. Posts are spaced evenly around each
                    structure with large supporting beams in the center. The Samoans favor round shaped roofs not only for their
                    beauty and symmetry, but also for practical purposes. The round shape allows the rain to quickly run off to the
                    ground with out any obstructions. The dome shaped structure are also durable and up keep is minimal, but
                    most importantly they keep the interior cool and breezy during hot, humid days. Samoa’s location near the
                    equator means the weather is often hot and humid, which is why you will notice that none of the buildings have
                    walls.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">

                            the right to block wind or rain. Some pola in the
                            raised position can also be seen on the right of the
                            building where the men of the village have gathered</figcaption>

                <p class="parcenter">The breeze comes in off the ocean and helps to
                    cool the occupants. Woven coconut leaf
                    blinds, called pola, are attached to the beams
                    of the buildings which can be lowered during
                    strong winds, storms, or when privacy is
                    desired. Roofing materials come from the
                    leaves of the sugar cane plant, some of which
                    are grown here in our plantation. The leaves
                    are bundled together and cleverly attached in
                    rows, round and around, until the whole roof
                    is covered. A first time thatch job will last 10-
                    15 years without repairs – in the absence of
                    excessively strong winds.</p>

                    <h2>Samoan Kitchen and Cooking</h2>
                    <p>In Samoa, the kitchen was the man’s domain because the preparation and cooking of food were considered physically demanding tasks.</p>
                    <p>The Samoan earth oven, called an umu, is a typical hot rock oven which is laid out above the ground.</p>
                    <p>Round river or lava rocks are used because they conduct heat extremely well.</p>
                    <p>Four logs are arranged in a square with rocks, and a fire is built to heat the rocks.</p>
                    <p>When the rocks are white with ash, charcoal debris is pushed aside and the food is placed on the heated rocks.</p>
                    <p>Fire-resistant leaves are used to protect the food so it is not burnt.</p>
                    <p>The whole oven is then covered with banana leaves and other insulating materials.</p>

                    <h2>Roles and Respect in Samoan Culture</h2>
                    <p>Hunting, climbing coconut trees, husking, cracking and milking coconuts all required physical strength.</p>
                    <p>The young men of the family show their respect to their parents, grandparents, and women by performing these arduous tasks.</p>
                    <p>The young men prepare the food and serve their grandparents and parents first.</p>
                    <p>Then the young children eat, and finally the cooks eat.</p>
                    <p>This service is part of the Samoan Way of Life, or Fa’a Samoa, in which respect is taught at a young age.</p>
                    <p>Young men serve their parents and elders in the same way their future children will serve them when they start their own families.</p>

                    <h2>Importance of the Coconut</h2>
                    <p>The coconut is one of the most important items in the life of Samoans and other Polynesians.</p>
                    <p>From the various parts of the coconut tree, materials for buildings, clothing, and food preparation are obtained.</p>
                    <p>The first step that must be done to use the coconut is to climb the very high tree to get it.</p>
                    <p>In the Samoan village, you can see how skillful the young men are at climbing the coconut trees, obtaining the coconuts, husking them and extracting its inner flesh for cooking purposes.</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Coconut Processing</h2>
                    <p>Once husked using a very sharp stick, the actual nut itself appears to have a face on one end.</p>
                    <p>Each coconut appears to have two eyes, a nose, and a mouth.</p>
                    <p>To crack open a coconut, a Samoan uses a heavy object or stone and hits the line that runs across the face.</p>
                    <p>The clear liquid inside the coconut is the juice.</p>
                    <p>Young coconuts that have not begun to produce much inner flesh contain more juice than ripe coconuts.</p>
                    <p>The coconut juice obtained from the very young coconuts is a refreshing drink in Samoa.</p>

                    <h2>Making Coconut Milk</h2>
                    <p>Inside the coconut is the white meat that can be grated and squeezed through a strainer made from various wood fibers.</p>
                    <p>The white liquid that falls from the grated coconut is coconut milk and is used in all types of Samoan cooking.</p>
