                <p><strong>Greeting Word:</strong> Iorana</p>
                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 3,000</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Rapa Nui is located about 4,300 miles southeast of Hawaii (it's actually closer
                    to Antarctica). It is approximately 2,000 miles to the East of Tahiti and
                    approximately 2,200 miles off the coast of Chile, making it one of the most
                    isolated islands in the world. Its nearest neighbor, tiny Pitcairn Island is over
                    1,200 miles away.</p>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Rapa Nui, according to research and oral traditions, was once covered
                    with trees, which have since all been cut down, possibly to aid in the
                    construction and transportation of the almost 900 moai or stone monuments.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="parcenter">There has been much controversy and confusion concerning the origins of the Easter Islanders. Thor
                    Heyerdahl proposed that the people who built the statues were of Peruvian descent, due to a similarity
                    between Rapa Nui and Incan stonework. Some have suggested that Easter Island is the remnant of a lost
                    continent, or the result of an extra-terrestrial influence. Archaeological evidence, however, indicates discovery
                    of the island by Polynesians at about 400 AD - led, according to legend, by Hotu Matua. Upon their arrival, an
                    impressive and enigmatic culture began to develop. In addition to the statues, the islanders possessed the
                    Rongorongo script; the only written language in Oceania. The island is also home to many petroglyphs (rock
                    carvings), as well as traditional wood carvings, tapa (barkcloth) crafts, tattooing, string figures, dance and
                    music.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Easter Island forms the eastern apex of the Polynesian Triangle. Rapa Nui is a small volcanic island that
                    encompasses about 67 square miles of land mass, and at its highest point rises to about 1,700 feet. It is famous
                    throughout the world for its historic stone statues, which the Polynesian people there call moai.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Rapa Nui is located about 4,300 miles southeast of Hawaii (it's actually closer to Antarctica). It is
                    approximately 2,000 miles to the East of Tahiti and approximately 2,200 miles off the coast of Chile, making it
                    one of the most isolated islands in the world. Its nearest neighbor, tiny Pitcairn Island is over 1,200 miles
                    away. Rapa Nui, according to research and oral traditions, was once covered with trees, which have since all
                    been cut down, possibly to aid in the construction and transportation of the almost 900 moai or stone
                    monuments.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Oral tradition says the years between discovery and first contact with the western world were filled with
                growth to a population as large as 10,000, as well as the creation of the moai, but also with civil warfare,
                cannibalism and the complete deforestation of the land. Just under 3,000 people live on Rapa Nui today, most
                of them Polynesians. Like many of the other Pacific islands during the 18th through early 20th centuries,
                European diseases and indentured labor practices decimated the population. At one point in the early 1900s
                there were only 111 Rapa Nui people left on the island; and while the slowly growing population has
                managed to hang on to much of their Polynesian culture, a great deal was also lost forever.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">For example, the people of Rapa Nui may have been the only Polynesians to have something akin to a writing
                    system in the form of their rongorongo tablets, a few samples of which have survived to present times in
                    widespread museums. The ability to translate them, however, seems to have been lost forever as there is no
                    one alive today who can read or translate the tablets.
                </p>
                <p id="pcc" class="parcenter">Dutch Admiral Jacob Roggeveen came upon Rapa Nui on Easter Sunday, 1722, hence the English name Easter
                    Island. In 1852 Chile annexed the island, and it remains a territory of that nation to this day.</p>

                <h2 class="AT">THE PCC EXHIBIT:</h2>
                <p class="parcenter">The Polynesian Cultural Center added this Rapa Nui exhibit as part of its 40th anniversary celebration in 2003.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">In preparing for the new exhibit, the Polynesian Cultural Center, with the consent of the government and
                    cultural elders of Rapa Nui, invited four respected stone carvers to Laie, Hawaii, where they created seven
                    authentic moai: two of them approximately 6 meters long are reclining (one of them intentionally left partially
                    finished) and the other five about 3.5 meters high have been erected on an ahu or burial platform patterned
                    after the famous one in Rapa Nui: Ahu Nau Nau at Anakena.
                </p>
                <p id="ahu" class="parcenter">When the four Rapa Nui carvers finished their work in the spring of 2003, they named the platform where the
                    five moai now stand Ahu Tu'u Koihu in honor of the first Rapa Nui chief who oral history says started the
                    tradition of building the statues that have become icons of Polynesia to the rest of the world.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2 class="AT">AHU: Burial Platform
                </h2>
                <p class="parcenter"> The ahu, or burial base or platform, you see before you were traditionally used as a burial place for the
                    Ariki or King and Tagata Honui or Chiefs. This one is patterned afteran actual ahu called Ahu Nau Nau
                    in Anakena on Easter Island, which is believed to be the bay where the first Polynesian settlers of Rapa
                    Nui arrived under the leadership of Chief Hotu Matu’a of what is now French Polynesia. </p>
                <p class="parcenter"> Moai is the word given to describe these carved stone statues in general. The moai here on the ahu
                    represent each Ariki or Tagata Honui that were traditionally buried beneath it. Each stone carving is
                    unique and have their own distinguishable characteristics that resemble the individuals they are
                    representing. After the Moai are erected in their final resting place, they are given the same name as the
                    person they portray.</p>
                <p class="parcenter"> The pukao, or large red scoria stone on the head of the Moai, represents the statue’s hair. Ancient Rapa
                    Nui men had long reddish colored hair bleached by the sun, which they would bundle up and wear on
                    the top of their head. </p>
                <p class="parcenter"> The mata, or eyes on the moai, are carved from white coral found on the ocean’s floor. The carvers told
                    how they each dived and brought pieces of white coral with them to Hawaii to make the "eyes" for the
                    moai; and after they placed these eyes into the sockets they had carved, then the moai were no longer
                    "blind," but now "could see”. The eyes give life to the moai and, therefore, to the people who were
                    [traditionally] buried under the ahu." The inner layer, or pupil of the eye is made of the finest red scoria
                    stone on Easter Island. </p>

                <h2 class="AT">MOAI:
                </h2>
                <p class="parcenter">Since they came to the attention of the outside world, the moai have captured the fascination of everyone
                    who sees them. These stone statues range from just a few feet high to almost 80 feet high, and are made
                    from scoria — or hardened volcanic ash. Unfortunately, scoria is not very durable, and ongoing
                    conservation of the existing moai is a major concern. It’s believed that all the moai on Rapa Nui were
                    carved from the same quarry, Rano Raraku. There are still some unfinished Moai in the quarry today.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">In all, the islanders created almost 900 statues, although the majority of those were never transported
                    from the quarry or even finished. </p>
                <div class="image-left4">
                    <img src="images/RA2.png" alt="">
                    <p>It is unclear why the Easter
                        Islanders turned to statue
                        construction on such a
                        massive scale. Their
                        obsession with it arguably
                        contributed to their
                        downfall as they depleted
                        more and more of the
                        forests for use in the process
                        of moving the giant moai.
                        While the ‘why’ is a
                        mystery, ‘where’ it
                        happened and to a large
                        degree ‘how’ it happened is
                        fairly clear. Each moai was
                        born from the massive
                        caldera of Rano Raraku.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="parcenter">The soft volcanic tuff was perfect material for statue carving. Using harder volcanic rock implements
                    they were able to first sketch out the moai's outline in the rock wall and then systematically chip away
                    at it until the moai was held in place by a thin "keel."
                </p>
                <p>The moai carvers were master craftsmen that had rose through the ranks of a "carver's guild." The
                    production of the statues was most likely through conscripted labor with many rituals and ceremonies
                    performed throughout the process. The stone carvers were ingenious in making the most out of sections
                    of rock. moai can be seen carved in all directions in the cliff face. If a defect would appear in the rock
                    the statue would be abandoned and they moved on to another area. They took advantage of fissures in
                    the volcanic walls and also variations in colors. In short they were true artists.
                </p>
                <div class="image-left4">
                    <p>Many theories have
                        been put forth about
                        why they were carved
                        and how people without
                        sophisticated machinery
                        could move the heavy
                        megaliths. One island
                        tradition says those moai
                        that were eventually set
                        up on ahu platforms
                        facing the ocean
                        "walked" there. Those
                        with more of an
                        engineering orientation
                        say this is feasible,</p>
                    <img src="images/RA3.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p class="parcenter">suggesting the people may have used a series of long ropes and log rollers to tip a moai a little toward
                    one side and then pivot it forward on the resting point, much as one person can move a heavy object
                    by rocking it forward without having to pick it up. This and similar theories also suggest that all of the
                    trees on the island were eventually cut down to provide the log rollers. Another widely publicized
                    author at one time suggested extraterrestrial beings were somehow involved in the process.
                </p>
                <p id="vaka" class="parcenter">The largest one is still in the mountain quarry and measures approximately 70 feet tall. On Rapa Nui,
                    there are several moai that can be found on the ground in much the same way as this Moai is displayed.
                    This was a consequence of tidal waves and other natural disasters, erosion and tribal wars, which
                    resulted in rivals toppling the Moai on their enemies.</p>

                </h3>
                <p class="parcenter">Hare Vaka, or boat house, is the name Rapa Nui people called this structure, because when completed
                    it looks like an overturned canoe. This structure is a scaled down model. Traditionally theses structures
                    extended 30 – 60 feet. There are records however of Hare Vaka that measured up to 300 feet, or roughly,
                    the size of a football field.

                    winds. The lack of trees and any significantly large mountains or hills meant there was no natural
                    barriers to the strong winds that swept right over the islands.

                    This structure was created to
                    protect the delicate plants from
                    strong winds. Rapa Nui has an
                    average elevation of 200 feet
                    above sea level. The winds that are
                    generated at sea have little to no
                    resistance from the islands.</p>
                <p>Rapa Nui people found that they
                    could protect the plants from the
                    winds by creating rock walls
                    around them. These walls would
                    also help the plants gather water
                    from the infrequent rains during
                    the summer months. The Mana
                    Vai housed Rapa Nui staple foods

                    birdman period. Several structures like this can be found on the edge of Oronga crater in Rapa Nui. This
                    is where the traditional Tangata Manu, or birdman competitions were held.</p>

                <p>High on the rim of the crater known as Rano Kau was the ceremonial village of Orongo. Built
                    to worship the god of fertility, Makemake, it became the site of a grueling competition.
                    Each year leadership of the island was determined by the individual who could scale down the
                    vertical slopes, swim out to one of three small islets in shark-infested waters, and bring back
                    the egg of the nesting sooty tern unbroken. The one who did this successfully was considered
                    the Birdman of the year and was bestowed with special honors and privileges.</p>

                <p>One of the most fascinating sights at Orongo are the hundreds of petroglyphs carved with
                    birdman and Makemake images. Carved into solid basalt, they have resisted ages of harsh
                    weather. It has been suggested that the images represent birdman competition winners. Over
                    480 Birdman petroglyphs have been found on the island, mostly around Orongo.</p>
