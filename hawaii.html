                <p><strong>Greeting Word:</strong> Aloha</p>
                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong>  1.3 million</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Hawai’i, at the northern apex of the Polynesian Triangle and the only major
                    part of Polynesia above the equator, is located approximately 2,500 miles
                    [4,000 km] west south west of the US Mainland.</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> Eight major islands (seven
                    inhabited) and over 100 smaller ones cover approximately 6,400 square miles
                    (16,600 km²). </p>
                <p><strong>Factoid:</strong> Some modern Hawaiians are striving to re-establish a recognized
                    form of sovereignty, perhaps similar to Native American Nations in other
                    parts of the U.S.</p>
                
                <br>
                <p class="parcenter">The Hawaiian greeting of ALOHA is probably the most well known Polynesian word. Of the more than twenty
                    islands in the Hawaiian group, only seven are inhabited. Hawaii spreads over a distance of about 400 miles.
                    The eight main islands (seven of which are inhabited) are volcanic islands while the others are small coral
                    islands. Together, they comprise about 6,424 square miles of land. The population of approximately 1.3million
                    (80% of which live on Oahu) is composed of a mixture of Polynesians, Asians, and Caucasians.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Hawaii has a mild, tropical climate with seasonal temperature fluctuations of only about 10 degrees. The islands
                    are exposed to yearly Northeast trade winds. More rain falls on the island of Kauai than on any other spot on
                    earth. The first Hawaiians migrated from the Marquesas Islands approximately 30-40 generations ago settling
                    first on Kauai and Oahu. A late migration from Tahiti settled on Hawaii and Maui. Many have tried to discover
                    when the migrations took place, but no one knows the exact date. Communication between Hawaii and Tahiti
                    remained active.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">After an initial discovery by the Spaniard Gaetano, the Hawaiian Islands were rediscovered by Captain James
                    Cook in 1778. Captain Cook named the discovery the “Sandwich Islands” after his patron, the Earl of Sandwich.
                    King Kamehameha I united the islands into an independent kingdom in 1796. This period of royal rule
                    stretched until 1893 when Queen Liliuokalani’s monarchy was overthrown and Hawaii was annexed by the
                    United States of America in 1898. Later, in 1959, the Hawaiian Islands were officially named the "Aloha State"
                    when they officially joined the U.S. as its fiftieth state. Since gaining statehood, Hawaii’s economy has evolved
                    from one dependent on sugarcane and pineapple crops to a profitable economy based on tourism. It is Hawaii’s
                    largest source of revenue.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">The official State bird is the Nene, or Hawaiian Goose, which is native to Hawaii and protected as an endangered
                    species. Prior to 1778 (when Capt. James Cook arrived) there were about 25,000 Nene. By the mid 1900's, wild
                    Nene numbered less than 30. Breeding programs at Slimbridge in England and Pohakuloa, Hawaii have helped
                    bring the current population in Hawaii up to about 3,000 birds.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Samoans are raised in villages, or nu'u, such as this one at the Polynesian Cultural Center. The courtyard found
                    in each village is called the malae and accommodates the traditional festivities and ceremonies of the village.
                    Each of the structures in a Samoan village serves a special purpose.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">The State Tree of Hawaii is the Candlenut or kukui, whose nut is rich with natural oils. The nuts of this tree
                    provided the ancient Hawaiians with light, oil, relishes, and medicine. The kernels are strung together with
                    coconut mid-ribs and lit to be used as candles. Each kernel has enough oil in it to burn for approximately eight
                    minutes. Because of it’s rich content, it was also used as a laxative. The oil was also used to partially waterproof
                    canoes and small water craft.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE VILLAGE</h4>
                <p>This village is patterned after a typical Hawaiian family compound from around 1750 A.D. Each
                    family had a single-room hut which was used mostly for sleeping. In ancient Hawaii, each household
                    consisted of a number of separate, but associated huts that together comprised what was called the
                    ‘kauhale’ (dwellings). Thus, each household could have several houses in one area, as well as a
                    different cluster in another area, and the ‘kauhale’ were frequently separated by some distance.</p>
                <p>Further, there were specific functions assigned to various houses in each cluster, with certain
                    dwellings designated as sleeping huts, others for eating (men ate separately from the women and
                    children, for their eating hut was regarded as a religiously significant place in which food offerings
                    were made to the gods and ancestors), and cooking huts that consisted of stone walled areas with
                    thatched roofs for food preparation. There were other huts within the kauhale that were task specific
                    as well, such as those for canoe makers and others used to house fishing gear. These buildings
                    belonged to the entire village, and not to one particular family.</p>
                <p>Hawaiian structures are covered with pili grass, which is found on higher altitudes. The grass is
                    bundled and layered on the cross beams and frames of the buildings. Pili grass contains a natural
                    waxy substance that causes it to stick together when wet. This provides an ideal waterproof covering
                    for the buildings. This 'sticking together' is called pili in Hawaiian. When the leaves dry out, they
                    separate again, allowing for air circulation within the buildings.</p>
                <p>The inside of the buildings are lined with lauhala, or pandanas leaves. This leaf is very universal in
                    Polynesia and is used by the islands people for weaving. Enclosed buildings typically did not have
                    windows or additional doors, and normally the doors were low and one had to bend down or crawl to
                    enter, however, for our guests’ convenience and ease of access, you will find normal doors and windows
                    on the structures here.</p>

                <h2>AHUPUA’A:</h2>
                <p>The concept of private property was unknown to ancient Hawaiians, but they did follow a complex
                    system of land division. All land was controlled ultimately by the highest chief or king who held it in
                    trust for the whole population. A whole island, or mokupuni, was divided in smaller parts, down to a
                    basic unit belonging to a single family.
                </p>
                <img class="image" src="images/ahupuaa.png" alt="">
                <p>Each mokupuni was divided into several moku, the largest units within each island, usually wedge-
                    shaped and running from the mountain crest to shore. O`ahu was divided into six moku.
                </p>
                <p>Each moku was divided into ahupua`a, narrower wedge-shaped land sections that again ran from the
                    mountains to the sea. The size of the ahupua`a depended on the resources of the area with poorer
                    agricultural regions split into larger ahupua`a to compensate for the relative lack of natural abundance.
                    Each ahupua`a was ruled by an ali`i or local chief and administered by a konohiki.</p>
                <p>Each ahupua`a contained the resources the human community needed, from fish and salt, to fertile land
                    for farming taro or sweet potato, to koa and other trees growing in upslope areas. Villagers from the
                    coast traded fish for other foods or for wood to build canoes and houses. Specialized knowledge and
                    resources peculiar to a small area were also shared among ahupua`a.</p>
                <p>Although there was no private ownership of property, land tenure of the maka`ainana (commoners)
                    was stable. They paid weekly labor taxes and annual taxes to the konohiki, or local overseer, who
                    collected goods to support the chief and his court. The konohiki supervised communal labor within the
                    ahupua`a and also regulated land, water and ocean use.</p>
                <p>Stewardship of the land and its resources was formalized through the kapu system. The kapu (taboo) -
                    administered and enforced by konohiki and kahuna, or priests - placed restrictions on fishing certain
                    species during specific seasons, on gathering and replacing certain plants, and on many aspects of social
                    interaction as well. In this way, the community maintained a sustainable lifestyle. Through sharing
                    resources and constantly working within the rhythms of their natural environment, Hawaiians enjoyed
                    abundance and a quality lifestyle with leisure time for recreation during the harvest season of the year.
                    This lifestyle also encouraged a high level of artistic achievement. Many crafts, including Hawaiian kapa
                    and featherwork, were the finest in the Pacific. Hawaiians devoted themselves to competitive sport and
                    martial arts as well as expression through dance and chant, creating rich traditions that continue today.

                <p>A halau was a very important house in Hawaii. Within buildings like this, much of the culture, history
                    and heritage passed from one generation to the next. Knowledge was passed orally through stories,
                    chants and dances in special buildings such as this. It is a place of learning and growth.

                <br>
                <p>In ancient Hawaii their religious beliefs and practices did not permit the family the opportunity to eat
                    together. This building, the Hale Mua, was used by the men for eating, training young men, and other
                    religious activities. The women of the family had their own eating-house called Hale ‘Aina. All children
                    would eat with their mother in the women’s eating-house until the young boy turned 8, 9 or 10. The age
                    varied in different areas. At that time he would move into the Hale Mua and learn the ways of men.
                    This type of societal rule called kapu, also prevented women from eating certain foods like bananas,
                    coconuts and specific types of fish. It was followed until the year after Kamehameha’s death, when
                    Liholiho (Kamehameha II) ate together with his mother, Ka’ahumanu, abolishing the kapu.

                <p>The <strong> ipu </strong> is a gourd that grows like a pumpkin or a squash. The shell was used as a bowl or container.
                    The la’amia is another gourd, but this one grows on a tree. This gourd too is dried, hallowed and used
                    as a bowl. <strong> La'i </strong> or ti leaves are used like tin foil wrapping when doing barbques. They store the cooked
                    food in the leaf or wrap the raw foods in the leaf and cook it. Various woods were used as bowls and
                    trays as you can see.
                </p>
                <p>In the corner of the building there are <strong> ki'i </strong> or god images honored by the Hawaiian people. In
                    relationship to the gods, if the family had a problem that they could not solve the patriarch of the family
                    would sleep in this building and with the help from the gods, the solution to the problem would be
                    revealed in a dream.

                </h3>
                <p>Of all the buildings used by the Hawaiian family, the hale noho had the least restrictions. In this
                    building the family could meet and share thoughts. The building was also used by the family as a
                    sleeping house. Because they lived with extended family and everyone slept together, there were
                    assigned area for sleeping. Children slept on the outer ends of the hales, and adult males slept closest
                    to the doors to protect their families in case of attack.
                </p>
                <p>Beds were very simple. Pili grass and dried leaves were spread on the pebbled or sandy floors for
                    cushioning. Mats were often placed over the grass to serve as beds. During the day, they were put out
                    in the sun to cleanse and refresh them, then brought back in for use during the night.

                <p>The Hale Hana could be used for many different purposes. Hana means ‘to work’, so this is a workshop

                </h2>
                <p>Weaving is done primarily with lauhala or Pandanas leaves. The pandanus tree has a fruit that
                    resembles, and is sometimes mistaken by visitors, for pineapple. The fruit on the tree is called puhala,
                    and when it ripens turns a bright red, yellow or orange depending on the variety of the tree. It is often
                    used for making leis. The fruit is made up of smaller sections that when united makes the ball you see
                    on the tree. These sections in ancient times, when ripe, were chewed on by the Hawaiian children and
                    used as a type of candy. One can also take these dried sections and peel them open for meat on the
                    inside that are like pine nuts. The skin is so tough, that adults used this only during times of famine
                    when there was nothing else available.</p>
                <p>The leaves are picked and dried. Then the thorns down the sides and back are removed, the leaf is
                    cleaned, flattened, and stored in rolls called poka’a. When they need to weave they strip the leaves to
                    the appropriate size and commence making the items desired.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The Hale Ali'i represents the house of the ali’i or chief. It was built on the most prominent rise in the
                    area and was often further elevated by a stone platform. Besides establishing the owner’s elevated
                    social status, this architectural style also protected the house from floods. The exterior thatching is of
                    pili grass, which was sometimes then covered with large fishing nets to keep the grass from curling
                    and looking untidy. The roof in the interior was usually thatched with pandanus leaves, and mats
                    covered the floor. The Hale Ali’i was primarily a place for the chief to sleep, rest or confer with other
                    leaders. In ancient times the Hale Ali’i was forbidden to women and children.</p>
                <p>All the items in this building are items related to the rule of the Chief. In ancient time feathers were like
                    diamonds to the Hawaiians. They were set aside and used to adorn people of nobility. Symbolic of the
                    chief’s prestige, the Hale Ali’i often had kahili displayed on the outside or the inside. These kahili, or
                    royal insignia, were made of feathers owned only by the Ali’i and are comparable to flags or banners
                    carried for the royal courts in Europe. The kahili always preceded the Ali’i to alert the people to bow
                    low as he approached as a token of respect. Similarly, the priests, or kahuna, would often precede the
                    Ali’i carrying the taboo staff, called pulo’ulo’u (a stick covered with a ball of white tapa material at the
                    top), which was intended to ward off evil spirits. This was used like a no trespassing sign. If the chief
                    wanted an area to remain private for his use, one would see this staff pegged in the area. If the chief was
                    in residence and did not want to be disturbed, you would see one outside the door.</p>
                <img class="image" src="images/H1.png" alt="">
                <p>The Ali’i, or High Chief, wore an ahu’ula or feathered cape. Many feathers they used were around the
                    size of a fingernail, so it took thousands of feathers for the making of these capes. There are two
                    distinguishing facts about these capes, the first being it’s size. The longer the cape, the higher the rank
                    of that chief. Also, the yellow or gold feathers of the birds were the most rare, so the more gold or
                    yellow on the cape, the higher the rank of that particular chief.</p>
                <p>The lei niho pala’oa was worn by both men and women and was crafted from braided human hair and
                    highlighted with a pendant carved from a whale's tooth in the shape of a curving tongue.</p>
                <p>The feathered crown or helmet is called the mahi’ole. There are two stories as to the shape of the helmet;
                    one speaks of the rainbow – a sign from the heaven. The other tells the story about the crest of the rooster
                    – a sign of authority. The helmet is made from the rootlets of the vine known as the ‘ie’ie which works
                    like rattan or wicker. After the frame is completed feathers may be added to it.</p>
                <p>Other items used by the mo’i wahine, or lady in waiting, included the crown, or lei hulu, made from
                    feathers bound into a circlet for the hair or the neck, and finely woven lauhala fans and delicate
                    feather kahili with decorated handles.</p>

                        <p>In Hawaiian checkers every time you move you must jump over your opponent. The board is
                            a set up alternating dark and white pebbles. To start the game place a pebble in each hand, place
                            your hands behind your back and rotate the pebbles until satisfied. Bring hands to the front and
                            your opponent selects a hand. The white pebble jumps first so with the 4 spaces available in the
                            middle of the board the game starts rotating turns always jumping over and opponents pebble.
                            One can double or triple jump but only in the same direction. There are no diagonal moves, one

                <h2>HULA:
                </h2>
                <p>Hula today is commonly divided into two broad categories. Ancient hula, as performed before Western
                    encounters with Hawaii, is called kahiko. It is accompanied by chant and traditional instruments. Hula as it
                    evolved under Western influence, in the 19th and 20th centuries, is called ‘auana. It is accompanied by song
                    and Western-influenced musical instruments such as the guitar, the ukulele, and the double bass.</p>
                <p>Hula is taught in schools called hālau. The teacher of hula is the kumu hula, where kumu means source of
                    knowledge. Hula dancing is a complex art form, and there are many hand motions used to signify aspects of
                    nature. The hand motions in hula are the focus, and different motions have different meanings. They tell the
                    story of the accompanying mele, or chant, and are meant to help convey the feelings and emotions of the
                    performers.</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li><strong>Hula kahiko</strong> encompassed an enormous variety of styles and moods, from the solemn and sacred to
                            the frivolous. Many hula were created to praise the chiefs and performed in their honor, or in honor of
                            the gods.
                            <p>This type of hula was considered a religious performance, rather than entertainment, which is why
                                you will notice that the dancers do not smile while they perform. As was true of ceremonies at the
                                he’iau (temple), even a minor error was considered to invalidate the performance. It might even be a
                                presage of bad luck or have dire consequences. Dancers who were learning to do such hula necessarily
                                made many mistakes. Hence they were ritually secluded and put under the protection of the goddess
                                Laka during the learning period. Ceremonies marked the successful learning of the hula and the
                                emergence from seclusion.</p>
                            <p>Hula kahiko is performed today by dancing to the historical chants. They are accompanied by
                                chanting and the beating of the ipu heke, or gourd drum and performed with a reverence for their
                                spiritual roots.</p>
                            <p>Hawaiian history was oral history. It was codified in genealogies and chants, which were memorized
                                strictly as passed down. In the absence of a written language, this was the only available method of
                                ensuring accuracy. Chants told the stories of creation, mythology, royalty, and other significant even ts
                                and people.</p>
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><strong>Hula ‘auana,</strong> or modern-style hula, arose from adaptation of traditional hula ideas (dance and mele)
                            to Western influences. The primary influences were Christian morality and melodic harmony. Hula
                            ‘auana still tells or comments on a story, but the stories may include events since the 1800s and are
                            more of an entertaining nature. The music is heavily Western-influenced, and usually includes the
                            accompaniment of less traditional instruments, like the guitar, steel guitar and ukulele.
                            <p><strong>There are two songs that are sung as guests learn the hula ‘auana in the Hawaiian village:</strong> </p>
                            <p class="center"> <strong>I Don’t Like Shoes </strong><br> I don’t like shoes upon my feet <br> To be at ease is such a treat and <br>I smile at everyone I meet; <br> That’s the Hawaiian in me. </p>
                            <p class="center"> <strong>Along the Beach </strong><br> Along the beach at Waikiki <br> A fair wahine is waiting for me, <br>With nice eyes and lovable charms <br> And a sweet Hawaiian hospitality. </p>

                </h2>
                <p>Lo‘i kalo are ponds for wetland kalo that are enclosed by banks of earth. They are constructed
                    near kahawai (streams) because they are irrigated with stream water. The Hawaiians used a system that
                    allowed water from the stream to run through an ‘auwai(ditch) into the uppermost lo‘i kalo and flow
                    through the openings in the terraces to each lower lo‘i kalo. The water is eventually discharged back into
                    the stream. Many steps went into making a lo‘i kalo.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Fish Pond</p>
                </h2>
                <p>Ancient Hawaiians had the most advanced fish husbandry system of the different island-nations of
                    the Pacific. They built fishponds along the shores and water inlets. They created rock walls that
                    allowed seawater to ebb and flow into the ponds. Gates built into the wall, would help circulate the
                    water, and also allow small fish into the pond. Once the fish were in, they would eat the algae and
                    other foods provided by the villagers. As they became larger, the fish would no longer be able to
                    leave the pond through the gates, becoming trapped inside. In this way, Hawaiians were always able
                    to maintain a readily available fish supply, which is important, since fish was their main form of
                    protein.</p>
