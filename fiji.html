                <p><strong>Greeting Word:</strong> Bula Vinaka</p>
                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 930,000</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Fiji straddles the International Date Line about 3,100 miles (5,100 km)
                southwest of Hawaii. </p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> The independent tropical nation covers approximately
                    7,050 square miles (18,270 km²) – slightly smaller than the U.S. state of New
                    Jersey – and includes two major islands plus about 330 smaller ones, and more
                    than 500 islets (tiny rock formations in the ocean that are unable to sustain
                    human habitation).</p>
                <p>The two main islands, Viti Levu & Vanua Levu, are rich in
                    resources, including gold and copper mines.</p>
                <p><strong>Known:</strong> Crossroads of the South Pacific</p>
                <p>Historically known as fierce warriors until soon after
                the paramount chief converted to Christianity in 1854.</p></p>
                <p class="parcenter">The islands of Fiji are regarded as the <strong>“Crossroads of the South Pacific”</strong> , where Melanesia and Polynesia meet.
                    Although it’s geographical location defines it as part of Melanesia, the language and cultural aspects of Fiji more
                    closely relate it to Polynesia.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Other than New Zealand, the islands of Fiji are larger than the rest of the Polynesian groups. There are a little
                    over 330 islands, 500 islets, and there are very distinct cultural differences from island to island. Because of the
                    great distance covered by the islands of Fiji there are a number of dialects or distinct languages spoken by the
                    various islanders. The Fijian language is made up of approximately <strong>20</strong> dialects and with the multi-racial makeup
                    of the country today, English is used as the official language. Approximately one third of the islands are
                    inhabited.
                </p>
                <div class="image-right">
                    <p>The first Europeans to land and live
                        among the Fijians were shipwrecked
                        sailors and runaway convicts from the
                        Australian penal settlements. Dutch
                        explorer, Abel Tasman, is credited with
                        its discovery in 1643. Major credit for
                        recording of the islands on modern maps
                        went to Captain William Bligh who
                        sailed through Fiji after the mutiny on
                        the Bounty in 1789.

                <p class="parcenter">Great Britain ruled over Fiji from 1874
                    until 1970 when Fiji became an
                    independent dominion and removed
                    Queen Elizabeth II as the Head of State.
                    There were other political disturbances
                    in 1987, 2000, and 2006 while Fiji
                    struggled to determine its future.. The
                    population of Fiji is today close to
                    930,000 (87%) of which live on Viti Levu
                    and Vanua Levu, the two main islands.
                    Suva, the largest city and capitol, is
                    located on Viti Levu.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">About 40% of the people are descendants
                    of laborers brought from India almost a
                    century ago in the indentured labor
                    system, as contract workers for the sugar cane plantations. 50% of the population is made up of indigenous
                    Fijians. The remaining 10% is a mixture of other races, including Chinese and Caucasians.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">The 20th century has brought important economic and political roles for Fiji. Fiji has been productive in its
                    sugar industry, copra milling, and tourism. Today, Fiji plays a major role in regional affairs and is recognized
                    as a focal point of the South Pacific.</p>
                <p id="structure" class="parcenter">The greeting of bula vinaka means more than just a simple hello. It literally means “Good Health” or “Good
                    Life”. In ancient times as people entered a Fijian village area, the lali, or wooden drum, would ring out to
                    announce the new arrival to the village.</p>

                <br>
                <p id="bure">There are two words that you will hear in Fiji referring to structures. One is bure and the other is
                    vale. Bure denotes the style of building and also a building used irregularly but for a specific purpose.
                    A vale denotes a structure used continually for domestic purposes, such as a family home, chief’s
                    home etc. You will notice that in most of the Bure very little furniture is found. The use of furniture
                    began as foreigners settled and brought other ways of life to Fiji.

                <figure class="picheader">
                    <img src="images/fj2.png" alt="">
                </figure>
                <br>
                <p>This structure is a typical bure or
                    house. Because Fiji consists of
                    many islands over a wide area,
                    house structures differ from
                    location to location. The
                    structures found here at the
                    Polynesian Cultural Center are
                    patterned after structures
                    found in the Lau group of the
                    islands of Fiji.
                </p>
                <p>The Bure is constructed with
                    layered reed walls lashed
                    together with sennit. As in all
                    Fijian structures, tapa cloth, or
                    masi as it is called in Fiji, is
                    dominant as decoration. The colors of Fijian masi are usually darker than in other Polynesian
                    cultures. In ancient times, masi had specific patterns that indicated the area a designer came from.
                    They often had genealogical significance for a family.

                <img class="image" src="images/fj3.png" alt="">
                <p id="levu">The roof is covered with a
                    sugarcane leaf thatching.
                    To keep the thatching free
                    of insects or animals that
                    would feed on the leaves, a
                    fire is often built inside the
                    building. The smoke rises
                    into the thatching, forcing
                    most animal life out of the
                    leaves, similar to today’s
                    fumigation methods. Fijian
                    structures are usually
                    constructed with very high-
                    pitched roofs that allow for
                    better air circulation inside
                    and for the frequent Fijian
                    rain to easily run off on the
                    outside. The roofs have a
                    life expectancy of ten to
                    fifteen years depending
                    upon the craftsmanship.

                <br>
                <p>A traditional Fijian village includes the chief's house, the largest structure and most elevated building,
                    unless that village had a Bure Kalou (see ‘Bure Kalou’ section). The Chief’s house’s stature was further
                    marked with white cowry shells, which you can observe hanging on the doors and at various locations,
                    both inside and outside the house.
                </p>
                <p>The front door in the east is the entryway for commoners and servants. The two side doors, facing north
                    and south, are entryways for the chief's wife and family and visiting dignitaries. The back door, always
                    facing the west, is reserved only for the chief himself. Anciently, armed warriors stood guard at the
                    chief’s door, and any person other than the chief who entered through it was put to death. Today, the
                    custom is still practiced, only without the warrior guards posted to enforce the protocol of tradition,
                    since it is a given that Fijians should know the correct door through which to enter.
                </p>
                <p>The chief’s bed is made of piled-up pandanus mats topped with tapa cloth. Frequently, a bamboo frame
                    was utilized, again filled with layers of mats to ensure softness. The floor would have a layer of sand,
                    covered with layers of dried leaves and soft branches, upon which would be piled layers of mats.
                </p>
                <img class="image" src="images/fj4.png" alt="">
                <p>The headrest seen on the bed is a typical Fijian pillow to keep the head elevated above the body. This
                    was necessary because the head was believed to be the location of the power of an individual. On a
                    more practical level, the luxurious Fijian "hair do" necessitated that shape of headrest. The lower bed is
                    for the chief's wife and children. If the chief practiced polygamy, the favored wife and her children
                    slept there. The other wives were sometimes provided sleeping quarters. At the opposite end of the
                    building, the chief would receive his guests and entertain them.</p>

                <h3 class="FJ">VALE NI BOSE: Meeting House
                </h3>
                <p>The Vale Ni Bose serves many purposes as it is used for ceremonial, official and private functions.
                    Ceremonial uses include the welcoming of village chiefs, discussing of official matters and the holding
                    of yaqona or kava ceremonies. During these meetings, women and children are forbidden in the
                    building. The yaqona or kava is a ceremonial drink that was served at these meetings. The root of the
                    kava, a plant of the pepper family, is dried and pounded into a powder, which is then mixed with water.
                    This drink is found in most cultures of the Pacific. As late as the 19th century, young maidens prepared
                    and served the kava to the elders of the village.</p>
                <p>Women and children sometimes use this building as an arts and crafts center. The major art forms of
                    Fiji are weaving, carving and pottery making. Using the leaves of the pandanus plant does most
                    weaving. The thinner and closer the weaving, the more valuable the product was. Items woven include
                    mats, baskets, fans, etc. The making of pottery in Fiji is a Melanesian influence dating back earlier than
                    1300 B.C. Pottery making was apparently known and practiced in Samoa and Tonga originally but was
                    abandoned due to their lack of clay. Archaeologists have discovered bits of pottery as far east as the
                    Marquesas.

                    <p>Lali or drums were used for long distance
                        communication. Through various rhythms a
                        message could be sent. Today a lali is used much
                        like a bell to call people to meetings or in time of
                        emergency.In ancient times the lali was used

                    Another form of communication favored by the
                    Fijian people is the conch shell. After a hole is cut
                    in the side of the shell, it is played much like a
                    horn. Fishermen would blow it when returning to
                    the village, indicating a good catch.</p>

                </h2>
                <p id="kalou" >Ancient and modern Fijian people used the DERUA or bamboo log, to provide rhythm as
                    accompaniment to music and dance. Holding a bamboo stick in each hand with the blocked end down,
                    the various lengths were pounded on the ground to create pitch and rhythm. With each hit, the air
                    within the hollow tube resonates, which results in a distinctive DERUA sound. The exact pitch or tone
                    is based upon the length of the bamboo and not the diameter. It has been found that DERUA can be
                    tuned in series with every 1/4 inch equaling a quartertone. The DERUA was a natural instrument in
                    Fiji. Bamboo grows hollow with a block at each joint. Lengths of bamboo were cut just below a joint
                    and all other blocks in the length were removed except the bottom one. All villagers could join in the
                    fun and festivity by pounding the DERUA.</p>

                <p>The Bure Kalou or spirit house was usually built on the highest mound in a village, even higher than
                    the chief's house. Strings of buli vulavula, or white cowry shells, hung from the lore or the two fern
                    stumps at the end of the highest point of the roof. The white cowry always indicated the highest form
                    of respect. In the bure kalou, the village bete, or priest, would sit inside at the bottom of a long strip of
                    masi, or white tapa hung from the ceiling of the structure. He was the only person allowed inside the
                    spirit house. The priest was thought to be conversing with the ancestral god, through the long strip of
                    masi. It was thought that in order to be successful in battle or leadership, the chief had to take food
                    offerings and sacrifices to the bure kalou regularly and consult with the bete.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The Fijian underground oven is called LOVO, which is basically a pit dug in the ground in which wood
                    and stones are placed for a fire. In other parts of Polynesia, it is known as an IMU or UMU. When the
                    wood burns down and the stones reach a high temperature, the food, which has been wrapped in leaves
                    to prevent scorching, is placed in the lovo. Ti leaves, breadfruit and banana leaves are most often used.
                    More leaves are used to cover the wrapped food. The complete lovo is then covered with earth to seal
                    the steam, which cooks and flavors the food.
                    Fijian people eat many various fruits and vegetables, including breadfruit, sweet potatoes, bananas,
                    tapioca, taro, and papaya. Fijians are also excellent fishermen and so their diet includes all forms of
                    fish, shellfish, and other edible sea life. Wild pigs and chickens are plentiful throughout the islands of
                    Fiji. When the first migrants arrived in the Pacific, they brought with them the pig and the dog from
                    Asia. Other livestock such as cattle and horses were not introduced until as late as the 15th & 16th
                    centuries.</p>     
                <p><strong>Copra:</strong></p>
                <p>The coconut is the most versatile and useful of all Polynesian plants. Copra is the dried flesh of
                    the coconut and used to be one of Fiji's major exports before it was surpassed by sugar cane
                    production. To make copra, a coconut is opened and the flesh is left in the sun to dry. From
                    the dried coconut, the rich oil is extracted. Both the fresh and dried flesh of the coconut is used
                    in various ways. The coconut flesh can be grated into coconut oil and then used for candles,
                    cosmetics, and soap or in cooking. The list of ingredients of many commercial products
                    including prepared foods and cosmetics includes the use of the coconut as one of the main
                    ingredients.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Canoes played an important role in the lives of the Fijians; they were used for social purposes, economic
                    reasons (trade) and for the most part political purposes. In times of war, canoes such as this were used
                    in sea battles for ramming enemy canoes as well as transporting warriors to sites of land battle. Superior
                    canoes conferred political</p>  
                <p>This is a Fijian Camakau (tha-ma-kau) or, a Fijian outrigger canoe. The Fijians are considered as some of
                    the finest canoe builders in the South Pacific. This particular canoe was constructed on an island east of
                    the main Fijian island group, known as KABARA. The men on this island were born craftsmen who were
                    very skilled canoe builders. In Fiji there are four classes of canoes:</p>   
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Drua</strong> - which is a double hulled canoe, and the largest class of canoes.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Takia</strong> - which is a smaller outrigger canoe with a dugout hull.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Camakau</strong> - which is a larger outrigger canoe with a covered hull.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li><strong>Tabilai</strong> - a war canoe with thick ends used for ramming.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>This particular canoe was built in 1985 and completed in just two months. After all the required rituals
                    and tests, this canoe was shipped to Hawaii by the then Prime Minister of Fiji, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara,
                    who is considered by many to be the Founding Father of the modern-day Fiji. The island of Kabara
                    where this canoe was built is part of the Lau group.</p>
                <p>This camakau was built using both modern and traditional tools. The tree was felled in the forest and
                    then moved to a convenient place, not too close to the village, where it was built. This historical event
                    was recorded and documented for the nearby Brigham Young University – Hawaii. It was presented
                    to PCC and BYU-Hawaii to be an educational tool for Pacific Island Studies majors.</p>
                <img class="image" src="images/fj10.png" alt=""> 
                <p>One of the most unique features of a camakau is its ability to change direction without taking time to
                    turn around. By merely adjusting the position of the sail, a camakau can go in the opposite direction
                    without having to turn around like other sailing vessels. Canoes like this normally travel at speeds up
                    to 8 – 9 miles per hour, but are capable of even greater speeds.</p>
                <p>More than 30 different plant species were used in the construction of this canoe. For example, this canoe
                    was built from a single 40 foot VESI LOG, or HEARTWOOD. The outrigger is made out of
                    NOKONOKO (Ironwood). Typically, the CAMA (Tha-ma - outrigger) would be made from UTO
                    (breadfruit tree). It is all lashed together with the MAGIMAGI or sennit rope braided from fibers of the
                    coconut husk.</p>
                <p id="warrior">The owner of a camakau was usually a chief, a village or an extended family due to the expenses
                    involved in owning a canoe, such as the many feast and presentations associated with the construction
                    of such a canoe.</p>

                <div class="image-left">
                    <img src="images/fj11.png" alt="">
                    <p>A little over a hundred years ago, the
                        Fijians were using many types of clubs.
                        Apart from the gadi, a small ornamental
                        club carried by correctly dressed
                        warriors and chiefs at peacetime
                        ceremonial occasions, all clubs were used
                        for war. They were therefore made of the
                        hardest woods, such as ironwood or vesi.
                        Many had fine linear carving on their
                        handles, designed by the individual
                        warrior who made and used the club.
                        <br><br>
                        The Iula were throwing clubs with short
                        handles and bulbous heads. These were
                        the most deadly Fijian clubs capable of
                        competing with revolvers in close
                        situations. </p>
                </div>
                <p>If the handle struck the
                    victim first it could penetrate the flesh,
                    the heavy head jack-knifing onto the
                    victim even if the handle did not pierce
                    him, thus dealing a crippling, if not
                    finishing blow.</p>
                <p>The cai or qata, the spurred or "gun
                    stock" clubs (so-called because of their
                    resemblance in appearance to rifle butts or
                    stocks), are designed for cutting and
                    disjointing blows. That of a rifle did not
                    inspire their shape although they look
                    similar to one, but rather by the shape of
                    the “bird of paradise” flower.
                    The waka or the root club had straight
                    handles with a natural knot of roots at the
                    end and were used to crush skulls easily.</p>
