                <p><strong>Greeting Word:</strong> Kia Ora</p>
                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 5.1 Million</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> About 4,606 miles (7,412 km) from Hawaii, forms the
                    southwest apex of the Polynesian Triangle.</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> covers approximately
                    103,000 square miles (268,000 km²) - about the size of Japan or the U.S. state of
                    Colorado – and consists of two major islands as well as several smaller island
                    groups. </p>

                <p class="parcenter">Legend tells us of the first explorer-navigator-discoverer of the islands. According to legend, Maui and his
                    brothers “fished up” the islands from the sea. The North Island is “The Fish of Maui” (a stingray). The South
                    Island is his canoe. Stewart Island is the anchor stone.</p>
                    <div class="image-left2">
                        <img src="images/stewart.png" alt="">
                        <p>Later, in the 10th century, Kupe &
                            Ngake (Ngahue) ventured out
                            southwest from Tahiti, following the
                            traditional navigational instructions
                            left by the hero Maui so many years
                            earlier. The instructions were simple --
                            they were to keep their bearings
                            towards a certain set of stars in the sky.
                            In their canoe, carved by their own
                            hands, they ventured out into the
                            unknown and reached their
                            destination. From far off, Kupe’s wife
                            sighted land, and the gathering of white
                            clouds around one of the mountain
                            tops. She called out, “He ao! He ao!”
                            (A cloud! A cloud!). Thus was Aotearoa
                            discovered. It’s Maori name means,
                            “Long White Cloud” and is commonly
                            referred to as “The Land of the Long
                            White Cloud”.
                           </p>
                    </div>  
                <p class="parcenter">Polynesians have been known to set sail
                    in search of new lands, their canoes
                    were provisioned with food and plants
                    for cultivation.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">They remained isolated in New
                    Zealand until the arrival of European
                    explorers, the first of whom was the
                    Dutchman Abel Tasman (1642). During
                    that time, they grew in numbers to
                    between 100,000 and 200,000, living
                    almost exclusively on North Island.
                    They adopted the name Maori to
                    distinguish themselves from the
                    Europeans, who after the voyages of
                    the Englishmen Captain James Cook
                    (1769-1777), began to come in greater frequency. Individuals, families, and extended family groups continue
                    to acknowledge one another and are identified as descendants of specific tribal and sub-tribal ancestral leaders.
                    These tribal leaders can trace their genealogy to the original settlers who arrived in multiple waves of migration
                    aboard ocean-voyaging canoes.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">It is situated in the South Pacific more than 1,000 miles southeast of Australia, its nearest neighbor. The country
                    is comprised of two main islands – the North and South islands – and a number of small islands, some of them
                    hundreds of miles from the main group. New Zealand is about 1,000 miles long and about 280 miles across at
                    its widest point. The land area is approximately 103,000 square miles – slightly smaller than the state of Colorado
                    and a little larger than the United Kingdom. The current population is 5.1 million, only about 17% of which are
                    native Maori., making them the largest group of Polynesians in the Pacific today.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">New Zealand’s climate differs from one part of the country to another. The larger South Island is colder than
                    the North Island. Exceptionally bitter winds sweep the mountain summits of both islands and there is snow in
                    the higher altitudes. Unlike other Polynesian islands, New Zealand experiences four distinct seasons.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Within one to two days drive, one can see glaciers, fiords, snow-capped mountains, vast plains and hills, sub-
                    tropical forests, a volcanic plateau and white-sandy beaches. The spectacular scenery of both major islands has
                    been featured in the Hollywood films, “Lord of the Rings“ & “Hobbit“ trilogies, “Wolverine“, “The Last
                    Samurai“ and more. Aotearoa New Zealand is one of the youngest nations, with voyaging canoes bringing the
                    first settlers from other Polynesian islands, as late as the 12th century.

                <br>
                <p class="parcenter">The mare is defined as a courtyard – the open area in front of a Maori meeting house and also refers to
                    the complex of other buildings surrounding it. Formal and informal interactions between people
                    continue to take place in such settings. They are associated with tribes and families and are located in
                    the historical tribal regions of these groups. All Maori connect to a marae through genealogy. It’s where
                    their parents, grandparents, or ancestors are from. Through generations of intermarriage, Maori are
                    able to connect to more than one marae.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">The name of this particular marae is “Te Arohanui o Te Iwi Maori”, meaning, “The Great Love of the
                    Maori People”. The name honors the Polynesian Cultural Center’s founding Maori performing arts
                    group, “Te Arohanui Maori Company which came to Hawai’i in 1963 to assist in the final preparations
                    of the Polynesian Cultural Center’s opening in October of that year.

                <p>The Fale Nonofo is the family dwelling house. Tapa is used to partition areas for sleeping. Fala, or mats
                    woven from the dried & softened leaves of the pandanus tree, are placed on the floor each night for
                    sleeping on, and rolled up and placed in the rafters each morning. The Fale Nonofo also serves as the
                    eating-place, where the food is served to the family, after being cooked at the tunoa.

                <p>As you observe the inside of this building, notice the cultural craftsmanship achieved by skilled workers
                    under the supervision of the master builder. The master builder is responsible not only for the physical
                    details, but also for the artistry of the building. A building of this size usually takes about 6-8 weeks to
                    complete depending on the number of men working and their skill levels
                </p>
                <p id="fale-fono">This particular structure also serves as a workshop in which men carve and women do arts and crafts.

                <br>
                <p>FALE TALIMALO: Guest House and FALE FONO: Meeting House (Same building; different purposes)
                    Fale Talimalo means “a house to receive guests.” Not only pre-arranged guests are welcome to stay
                    here, but also a person or group passing by who needs a place to rest. When pre-arranged groups arrive,
                    the family (immediate or extended or the village) will prepare leis, food and special decorations. A
                    special welcome ceremony would be included if the guest is a high ranking chief.
                </p>
                <p>When unexpected guests arrive, the immediate family will quickly prepare food and water. Bedding is
                    provided if the stay is extended. After the guests are fed and have rested, the chief will inquire as to the
                    purpose of the unexpected visit and the intended length of stay. He will then offer any further assistance
                    as needed.
                </p>
                <p>When not being used to host visitors, this building is also used as the Fale Fono, meaning, “meeting
                    house.” As a Fale Fono, this building is to serve the chiefs of the village as a gathering place to discuss
                    the affairs of the village. The discussions include monitoring the performance of individual families, the
                    safety of all the villagers, each family beautifying their yards, planting food crops and raising meat
                    animals to encourage self-reliance and generally maintaining order in the village.
                </p>
                <p>The posts surrounding the structure have special significance in Samoa. During meetings and
                    ceremonies, participants sit with their backs to a post representing their rank, family, or home village.
                    Some posts are reserved for various people of prestigious rank. The post centered at the left half of the
                    entrance is for the highest-ranking person in the visiting party, usually a chief. The post immediately
                    opposite is for the highest-ranking person of the home village, again usually a chief. The posts on either
                    side of the main entrance post are for the chief’s spokesmen known as the talking chiefs. The next two
                    posts on the left are for other local talking chiefs. Other minor participants sit on mats spread around
                    the outside rim. An interesting custom in Samoa is the fourth post from the left, known as the stranger’s
                    post. If a stranger comes into a meeting unannounced and demands it, the post must be surrendered to
                    him. From the three posts in the middle any food to be served during the meeting is dispensed.
                </p>
                <p>The kava ceremony takes place in this building. Not only does it represent the highest form of welcome
                    to guests, it also represents a unity of purpose. The significance lies in each chief drinking from the
                    same coconut cup, representing a solemn commitment to ally himself with the consensus of the council.
                    It is a sign of loyalty and symbolizes the highest ideals of all participants and the village people they
                    represent.
                </p>
                <p>The floor of this building is typical of what is found in Samoa. River pebbles and stones are gathered
                    from the nearby rivers and streams and spread to cover the interior area. The rocks help keep the house
                    cool and dry. If water does seep in, it spreads out under the rocks rather than pooling into hard-to-clean
                    puddles. Mats are placed on top of the rocks to provide comfort. The thicker the layer of mats, the softer
                    the seating area.
                </p>
                <img class="image" src="images/tapa.png" alt="">
                <p>Fine mats, or ie toga, used for ceremonies in this building, require special weaving skills. The pandanus
                    leaves are cleaned, boiled, and bleached in the sun until the desired shade of whiteness is reached. The
                    leaves are then flattened and left to season for about a week. The weaver then takes a shell or possibly
                    the sharp, hard wing of a coconut beetle and cuts the leaves into fine strands for weaving. Some of the
                    mats are woven so fine that they have the appearance of expensive linen. After a mat is completed, it is
                    given a name and used as the traditional currency of Samoa. Mats are given as gifts at weddings,
                    funerals, the dedication of buildings, chiefly ceremonies, and other special occasions. It takes many
                    years of work to make an exceptionally fine mat.

                <br>
                <p>Matai is the Samoan word for leader or chief. There are two types of matai in Samoa - the Ali’i and the
                    Tulafale. The Ali’i is the name of the highest title in a family. Those who hold an Ali’i title preside at
                    council meetings, oversee proceedings, make the final important decisions (after consulting with other
                    matai), and pass their instructions along in whispers to the High Talking Chiefs, or Tulafale, who are
                    the mouthpieces of the Ali’i. They are expected to be eloquent and skilled in the art of lauga (oration).
                    The Tulafale represent the Ali’i as his spokesperson. The political system of Samoa was much more
                    open than in any other Polynesian group in the Pacific. Rather than being solely hereditary, it is possible
                    for people to rise to chiefly status by virtue of his or her abilities, loyalty to the village, and the service
                    one provides to the families in the village. The title of chief is conferred upon any eligible member of
                    the group, including women, with the common consent of the village and the chief’s council. The chiefs
                    are responsible for the general welfare of the group.

                <p>The Maota Tofa is the Chief’s house. In Samoa, this building is usually elevated 5-8 feet signifying the
                    Chief’s prestige. A building of this size sometimes takes 3–4 months to build depending on the
                    manpower. The master builder, called the Tufuga, plans and instructs all workers of the measurements
                    of each beam and pole. He determines the fashion and the design of the sennit lashings, which hold all
                    joints in place. The way the beams are fastened together gives support to every 6--7 feet of the roof and
                    strengthens the roof against the strong winds and heavy rain. The large beams and the poles are cut
                    from the native trees of Samoa. The ifilele (Iron wood), koi (Mahogany), niu (Coconut), fau (Balsom).

                <p>There are three main reasons why a chief would have a building as large and beautiful as this. (1) The
                    chief is a well-respected individual by his family and the community and the building represents their
                    support and goodwill. (2) His title is of a royal line, or it is the highest in the family, village or district,
                    which he represents. (3) It represents the wealth of a strong family group or unified collection of villages.
                </p>
                <p>The chief’s house was simply furnished. Because finely woven mats were exchanged as currency, the
                    more mats a chief possessed and displayed, the richer he was. They were important also as a method
                    of paying tribute at weddings, funerals, and other public events.
                </p>
                <p>Only the chief would sleep on a bed, which is made of mats stacked to a desired height. Pillows were
                    made of bamboo and actually supported the head at the back of the neck. Samoans believe that sleeping
                    on a hard surface will give you a strong and straight posture.

                <p>War clubs were favored in tribal wars because Samoans preferred hand-to-hand combat. Throwing
                    weapons was disdained because it was considered cowardly. The clubs displayed here are carved from
                    Hawaiian wood. Notice that the club heads are patterned after things found in nature like the pineapple
                    and the sea urchin. Today, war clubs are finished with a coat of varnish or lacquer to preserve it and
                    give it a shiny finish. Traditionally, they were rubbed with a cowry shell for a special gloss.

                <h2>Tatau: The Art of Tattooing</h2>

                <p>Samoans have been practicing the art of tattooing for over 2000 years. Two Fijian women, Taema and
                    Tifaiga, introduced the practice of tattooing to Samoa. Today, Samoan males desiring chiefly status or
                    leadership roles are generally tattooed. Many other men acquire tattoos for their appeal as a mark of
                    adulthood, a symbol of cultural identity, a revival of an ancient craft, and an acceptable body decoration
                    of beauty.</p>
                <p>Before the arrival of missionaries, it was compulsory for all males to be tattooed. It was considered a
                    decorative art form, which visibly denoted rank and status. Young men were tattooed between the ages
                    of 14 and 18 when they had stopped growing so that the intricate designs would not stretch. Tattooing
                    extended from the hips down to the knees. Although there has been a revival of tattooing, it still does
                    not equal its former acceptance
                </p>
                <p id="terms">Tattooing is a painful process. The Samoan tattoo master creates the designs with a comb-like tattoo
                    instrument. The larger the comb, the greater the area on the skin is covered with fewer strokes. He
                    punctures the skin by tapping the instrument with a small mallet.
                </p>
                <p >Samoan women were also tattooed, but usually in lesser quantity.</p>
