                <p><strong>Greeting Word:</strong> Kia Ora</p>
                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 5.1 Million</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> About 4,606 miles (7,412 km) from Hawaii, forms the
                    southwest apex of the Polynesian Triangle.</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> covers approximately
                    103,000 square miles (268,000 km²) - about the size of Japan or the U.S. state of
                    Colorado – and consists of two major islands as well as several smaller island
                    groups. </p>

                <p class="parcenter">Legend tells us of the first explorer-navigator-discoverer of the islands. According to legend, Maui and his
                    brothers “fished up” the islands from the sea. The North Island is “The Fish of Maui” (a stingray). The South
                    Island is his canoe. Stewart Island is the anchor stone.</p>

                        <p>Later, in the 10th century, Kupe &
                            Ngake (Ngahue) ventured out
                            southwest from Tahiti, following the
                            traditional navigational instructions
                            left by the hero Maui so many years
                            earlier. The instructions were simple --
                            they were to keep their bearings
                            towards a certain set of stars in the sky.
                            In their canoe, carved by their own
                            hands, they ventured out into the
                            unknown and reached their
                            destination. From far off, Kupe’s wife
                            sighted land, and the gathering of white
                            clouds around one of the mountain
                            tops. She called out, “He ao! He ao!”
                            (A cloud! A cloud!). Thus was Aotearoa
                            discovered. It’s Maori name means,
                            “Long White Cloud” and is commonly
                            referred to as “The Land of the Long
                            White Cloud”.
                           </p>
                    </div>  
                <p class="parcenter">Polynesians have been known to set sail
                    in search of new lands, their canoes
                    were provisioned with food and plants
                    for cultivation.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">They remained isolated in New
                    Zealand until the arrival of European
                    explorers, the first of whom was the
                    Dutchman Abel Tasman (1642). During
                    that time, they grew in numbers to
                    between 100,000 and 200,000, living
                    almost exclusively on North Island.
                    They adopted the name Maori to
                    distinguish themselves from the
                    Europeans, who after the voyages of
                    the Englishmen Captain James Cook
                    (1769-1777), began to come in greater frequency. Individuals, families, and extended family groups continue
                    to acknowledge one another and are identified as descendants of specific tribal and sub-tribal ancestral leaders.
                    These tribal leaders can trace their genealogy to the original settlers who arrived in multiple waves of migration
                    aboard ocean-voyaging canoes.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">It is situated in the South Pacific more than 1,000 miles southeast of Australia, its nearest neighbor. The country
                    is comprised of two main islands – the North and South islands – and a number of small islands, some of them
                    hundreds of miles from the main group. New Zealand is about 1,000 miles long and about 280 miles across at
                    its widest point. The land area is approximately 103,000 square miles – slightly smaller than the state of Colorado
                    and a little larger than the United Kingdom. The current population is 5.1 million, only about 17% of which are
                    native Maori., making them the largest group of Polynesians in the Pacific today.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">New Zealand’s climate differs from one part of the country to another. The larger South Island is colder than
                    the North Island. Exceptionally bitter winds sweep the mountain summits of both islands and there is snow in
                    the higher altitudes. Unlike other Polynesian islands, New Zealand experiences four distinct seasons.</p>
                <p id="marae" class="parcenter">Within one to two days drive, one can see glaciers, fiords, snow-capped mountains, vast plains and hills, sub-
                    tropical forests, a volcanic plateau and white-sandy beaches. The spectacular scenery of both major islands has
                    been featured in the Hollywood films, “Lord of the Rings“ & “Hobbit“ trilogies, “Wolverine“, “The Last
                    Samurai“ and more. Aotearoa New Zealand is one of the youngest nations, with voyaging canoes bringing the
                    first settlers from other Polynesian islands, as late as the 12th century.

                <h2 class="AT">MARAE: The Courtyard</h2>
                <p class="parcenter">The mare is defined as a courtyard – the open area in front of a Maori meeting house and also refers to
                    the complex of other buildings surrounding it. Formal and informal interactions between people
                    continue to take place in such settings. They are associated with tribes and families and are located in
                    the historical tribal regions of these groups. All Maori connect to a marae through genealogy. It’s where
                    their parents, grandparents, or ancestors are from. Through generations of intermarriage, Maori are
                    able to connect to more than one marae.
                </p>
                <p id="puhara" class="parcenter">The name of this particular marae is “Te Arohanui o Te Iwi Maori”, meaning, “The Great Love of the
                    Maori People”. The name honors the Polynesian Cultural Center’s founding Maori performing arts
                    group, “Te Arohanui Maori Company which came to Hawai’i in 1963 to assist in the final preparations
                    of the Polynesian Cultural Center’s opening in October of that year.

                <h2 class="AT">PUHARA: Watchtower
                </h2>
                <p id="pataka">The watchtower or Puhara, was built to protect the village. Puhara were manned 24-hours per day. A
                    village was usually situated on top of a hill so that the extra height of the tower could allow a man to
                    see for miles on all sides. If strangers were approaching, the man in the watchtower would blow a large
                    wooden trumpet called the pukaea to warn the people in the village. A scout would then be sent to
                    ascertain whether the strangers came in peace or in war. Maori protocol calls for a ceremony-of-sorts
                    to be performed in these cases called powhiri in which the intent of the visitors is determined. You can
                    see the powhiri protocol demonstrated here in this village.

                </figure>
                <p class="parcenter">The food storage hut was also used to house heirlooms such as his jade pendants, weapons, adzes for canoe building, etc.
                </p>
                <p>The Maori people ate fish, shellfish, birds, and small animals. They often salted, dried, or smoked
                    various food items and placed them in gourds for storage. Sweet potatoes, tapioca, an d the 'Maori
                    Potato' were food staples.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">They also used roofed storage pits. These are partially underground with drainage on the sides of the
                    house. They were not only used to store food, but also to store the plants which would be used next
                    season.
                </p>
                <img class="image" src="images/ah19.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>As with other Polynesians, the Maoris cooked in open-air cooking spaces, in underground ovens called
                    a hangi. A pit was dug and logs were placed inside with rocks on top of the logs. As the logs burned,
                    the rocks fell into the pit. The food was then placed on the hot rocks and covered with leaves or mats
                    to keep the heat in for several hours, steaming the food.
                </p>
                <img class="image" src="images/ah21.png" alt="">
                <p id="tupuna">Other methods used were geothermal steaming, grilling food on sticks over embers, wrapping food in
                    clay or leaves and placing them on the embers, boiling food by placing red-hot stones in wooden bowls
                    of liquid.

                    <p class="subtitle">Ancestral Meeting House</p>
                </h3>
                <p class="parcenter">The Whare Tupuna, or the Ancestral Meeting House, is typical of those found in Maori villages in New
                    Zealand. Such buildings are very important to the Maori people because this is where customs and
                    ceremonies are maintained and perpetuated. In 1960, this particular building was commissioned,
                    carved in New Zealand under the direction of Master Carver Hone Taiapa and shipped to Hawaii piece
                    by piece where it was then put together for use here at the Polynesian Cultural Center.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">This ancestral meeting house is named after Hawaikiroa, an ancient mariner who arrived in these
                    islands (now known as Hawai’i) over 2,000 years ago, and according to legend, named them after
                    himself.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">The architecture and design of the building is full of symbolism. It represents the physical anatomy of
                    the human body of the ancestor for whom the building is named. The apex of this building has two
                    figures, the lower one, holding a paddle is Hawaikiroa, the common ancestor. The figure at the very
                    top, represents his son. The facing boards on the gable of the house represent his outstretched arms,
                    hands and fingers extended and reaching towards the ground. The ridgepole of the house represents
                    his spine or backbone and the painted rafters, his rib cage.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">Inside, the intricately carved figures on the walls represent the genealogy and family history of a tribe.
                    Each figure or poupou depicts a specific ancestor and indicates information about him and his
                    accomplishments. The eyes in the carvings were made from paua shell also known as abalone. The
                    carvings depict tattooed faces, piercing eyes, protruding tongues and flexed leg muscles in dancing or
                    fighting positions. These same traditional gestures are used today in dances performed in New
                    Zealand and here at the Polynesian Cultural Center.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">A person’s status in the community was determined by his bloodline. Hence, it was crucial for the
                    Maoris to memorize and recite their genealogies. These carved figures are constant reminders to the
                    people of their ancestry. The stories, histories and genealogies of these ancestors continues to be
                    preserved in the carvings, the oral history and music of the people. The present generation continue to
                    bear their names.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">Painted scroll ornamentations on the rafters are more than just decorative. They’re called kowhaiwhai
                    (circles within circles). They represent various foods and plants such as the sweet potato, peas, berries,
                    and curling fern and are symbolic of nature and its importance. They tell stories of local history,
                    symbolize aspects of the natural world and represent genealogies.</p>
                <img class="image" src="images/tupuna.png" alt="">
                <p  class="parcenter" id="kia">Between the carvings are the tukutuku panels that are woven by Maori women. Each design depicts a
                    particular tribal historical legend that is passed from generation to generation through the weaving of
                    these panels. The set of six panels on a stand at the end of the room tells the story of the original Maori
                    migration to New Zealand. They are woven from the dried leaves of the kiekie vine, which is found
                    abundantly throughout New Zealand. The yellow and white colors are the natural shades after drying
                    has taken place.</p>

                <h3 class="AT">KIA NGAWARI</h3>
                <p class="parcenter">Kia Ngāwari houses examples of the art of Māori weaving. Weaving techniques, include finger-weaving
                    (related to twining), ornamental lattice work, patterned strand work, braiding, weft twining and
                    plaiting</p>
                <p class="parcenter" id="kupe">One of the more important varieties of native plant species found in Aotearoa New Zealand is the flax
                    plant. The leaves can be used to craft mats, hats, bags, baskets, and even sails. The exposed inner
                    fibers can be dyed and braided or woven into rope, fishing nets and the flax-made kilts used in the
                    performing arts. Without the use of looms, weavers use the fibers to weave cloth, very similar to
                    linen, which can be used as a wrap-around cloak. Many cloaks today are beautifully adorned with
                    feathers.</p>

                <p class="parcenter">This Waka Taua or war canoe of New Zealand is one of the greatest examples of Maori carving.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">The canoe was named the ‘Long Fish of Māui’ (see Māui’s Legend above). Traditionally, a war canoe
                    was used as a raiding vessel along the coastlines, inland lakes and rivers. Fully manned, it could
                    reach a speed of up to 15 miles per hour (13 knots) for short distances. In some canoes, sails were also
                    rigged to add to the speed.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>HISTORY OF THE WAKA TAUA (WAR CANOE): TE IKA-ROA-A-MĀUI - The Long Fish of Māui</h4>
                <p class="parcenter">On the 6th of March 1948, it was announced that King George VI (r 1936-1952) and Queen Elizabeth would
                    embark on a Royal Tour of Australia and New Zealand the following Spring of 1949, accompanied by their
                    daughter Princess Margaret. They would be the first reigning monarchs to visit both countries.</p>
                <figure class="picheader">

                </figure>
                <p class="parcenter">As part of the many preparations that took place for this tour to New Zealand, a giant Kauri (Agathis
                    Australis) tree from the Puketi State Forest, Northland was felled in October of 1948.
                </p>
                <p>A Waka Taua (War Canoe) was to be crafted from this tree and used as part of the welcome ceremony for the
                    Royal Family by the Ngāpuhi people.
                    In addition, the canoe was to be presented as a gift to His Royal Highness.</p>
                <img class="image" src="images/ah2.png" alt="">
                <p class="parcenter">On the 23rd of November 1948, the tour was cancelled due to the King’s declining health. However, the work
                    of construction carried on until the hull of the canoe was sufficiently completed to be transported out of the
                    bush. The canoe was brought to rest near the Kohewhata Marae Hall, Mangakahia Rd, Kaikohe.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">The idea to complete the canoe resurfaced in the early 1960’s due to the Polynesian Village’s Project, which
                    was already underway in Lā’ie, Hawai’i and Tuhikaramea, Aotearoa, NZ.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Members of the Witehira, Wihongi and Tahere families are pictured here donating the hull of the canoe to the
                    Polynesian Villages Building Committee Supervisor, John Elkington, Sr. (front left) in la te 1962.</p>

                    genus of Agathis. Kauri trees can grow to over 50 metres (160+ feet) tall and up to 7 metres (23 feet) in

                <p class="parcenter">This is a Taiaha. The Taiaha served as a broadsword quarterstaff, club, and spear. It is a fire-hardened
                    wooden stave that had a long tapered, flattened shaft or blade, which broadens towards the end and
                    has a head, nose, eyes, lips, teeth, and mouth, with a tongue-shaped spearhead on the opposite end.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">The ancient Maori chiefs at ceremonial gatherings also used the taihaha. The Maori orator when making
                    a speech emphasized his words with gestures and taiaha actions called taki.</p>
                <img class="image" src="images/ah15.png" alt="">
                <p class="parcenter">The taiaha and greenstone mere (flat club) were both perfect weapons for close quarters combat. The
                    advantage of a shorter club like the mere is its portability. It was usually tucked into the back
                    waistband of the warrior’s skirt and hidden from sight behind a cloak.</p>
                <p  class="parcenter" id="activity">Weapons were often named after an ancestor.</p>

                <p><strong>Tītī-tōrea</strong></p>
                <p class="parcenter">Traditionally, this game was one of many military games played in childhood. The objective of the
                    game was to develop and maintain effective eye-hand coordination skills, essential in future hand-to-
                    hand combat. The game still teaches those same skills today.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">It requires players to simultaneously toss sticks back and forth to each other in various patterns and in
                    rhythm to music or chant. Players try to catch the sticks without dropping any of them and to have
                    fun.</p>
                <p><strong>Long-Poi</strong></p>
                <p class="parcenter">Poi is a light ball on a string of various lengths, swung or twirled rhythmically and in unison to sung
                    accompaniment. Traditional poi can be made from bullrush (cat’s tail leaves) and attached to a flax
                    cord or rope. Modern-day poi can be made with foam and plastic, while the handle can be plaited
                    from yarn or cord.</p>
                <p class="parcenter"  id="terms">Poi can be struck with either side of the hand and shoulder to create a percussive rhythm, imita te the
                    sounds, movements and rhythms of nature. Matched with song, it can be used to enhance
                    storytelling.</p>
