                <p><strong>Greeting Word:</strong>  Malo e lelei</p>
                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 120,000</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> The kingdom of Tonga – consisting of Ha’apai, Tongatapu and Vava’u island groups – is
                    the about 3,100 (4,950 km) southwest of Hawaii, or about two thirds of the way to New
                    Zealand. It is also east of Fiji and southwest of Samoa.</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong>  The approximately 170 islands, most
                    of which are low-lying and fertile, cover a landmass of about 280 square miles (710 km²).</p>
                <p><strong>Known:</strong> The Friendly Island of Polynesia</p>
                <p><strong>Fact:</strong> The letter ‘g’ in Tongan is always pronounced like ‘ng’ as in the English word singer – even
                    when it is the first letter in a word – and never as the word finger.</p>

                <br>
                <p class="parcenter">TONGA consists of more than 171 small groups of islands, which cover approximately 290 square miles of
                    land. Most of the islands of Tonga are low coral formations, except the Vava’u groups, which are of volcanic
                    origin. The climate is fairly cool, by tropical standards, with temperatures averaging about 80 degrees
                    between May and November and rising to about 90 degrees between December and April.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">Tonga has a population of about 120,000 people. It is the last remaining kingdom in Polynesia and is the only
                    island nation with the distinction of having never being formally colonized by a European power. Throughout
                    World War II, at the first King’s request, Britain protected Tongan interests under various treaties, but Tonga
                    has always maintained her autonomy. The present King of Tonga is His Royal Highness King ‘Aho’eitu
                    Unuaki’otonga Tuku’aho Tupou VI (regnal name: Tupou VI) who was the successor to King George Tupou V
                    (his brother).
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">As we look at the huts or structures in the Tongan Village you will notice that they are shaped very much like
                    others of Polynesia, especially Samoan huts, except that Tongan huts have thatched walls. Tapa is usually used
                    to line the inside of the walls of Tongan structures called fale. The support structures are lashed together with
                    coconut sennit. In former times, no nails or screws were used to hold the buildings together. Other building
                    materials are used to give the structures a dome-shaped appearance, which being higher, gives more efficient
                    ventilation keeping the inside some what cooler.</p>

                <br>
                <p>This building is called the Fale Fakatu’i and it is the exact quarter scale model of the former queen’s
                    summer house in Tonga. Queen Salote, a beloved and revered figure in Tongan history, had this
                    structure built here at the Polynesian Cultural Center by her personal workmen. This fale is raised on
                    a rock platform and supported inside by four large ironwood posts, typical of Tongan architectural
                    style. One of the typical roofing materials in Polynesia is sugar cane leaves as it is used on this structure.
                    This royal house is highly decorated with elaborate sennit lashings, fine reed walls, intricately woven
                    mats, and cowry shells. Dried coconut leaves are
                    placed on the floors and then covered with finely
                    woven mats which add extra softness.</p>
                <div class="image-left3">
                    <p>The addition of this special structure at the
                        Polynesian Cultural Center was important enough
                        to the royal family of Tonga that the Crown Prince
                        attended the dedication ceremony in 1963
                        representing his family. Inside, you will find
                        pictures of Tongan royalty. One picture is of King
                        George Tupou I, who emancipated his people and
                        established a constitutional government, based
                        upon Christian principles -- mainly the Ten
                        Commandments. Another picture is of King
                        George Tupou II. His daughter, Queen Salote
                        Tupou III, ascended to the throne in 1918 at the age
                        of eighteen, and ruled for 47 years until her death in
                        1965, is also pictured.</p>

                <p>She was followed by King
                    Taufa’ahau Tupou IV, who passed away in 2007.
                    He is credited for doing much to further education
                    in his land, and has been awarded an honorary
                    Doctorate Degree from Brigham Young University
                    for his interest in the progress of his people.

                    <p class="subtitle">Family Dwelling</p>
                </h2>
                <p>This structure is a typical dwelling house in Tonga. Behind the partition is the parent’s bedroom. The
                    bedding consists of layers of mats. Young children usually slept at the center of the fale. Each night
                    special mats were spread on which the children could sleep. In the morning the mats were rolled up so
                    that the center of the structure could also be used as the sitting room. As girls in the family reached
                    sixteen years of age, a partition was built to provide them with private sleeping quarters on the other
                    side of the building. Around age sixteen boys slept in a separate structure built especially for them. In
                    general, the only furnishings traditionally found in a Tongan home are mats and tapa cloth, which are
                    used extensively for decorating. The dwelling house is the scene for most family activities. Even the
                    courting of daughters by suitors takes place in the dwelling house so that all family members can meet
                    and evaluate the young man.

                    <p class="subtitle">also known as Fale Fakataha: Meeting House</p>
                </h2>
                <p>Most village or community meetings are held in this meetinghouse. Civic problems, community
                    affairs are addressed, and Kava ceremonies are performed here. Kava is often called "the official drink
                    of the Pacific.” In a kava ceremony, which is one of the highest forms of showing respect for guests or
                    village chiefs, the ranking chief sits on the elevated portion of the floor. The lower section of the floor
                    is for both men and women commoners. Anciently, village meetings took place once a month, but
                    today, meetings are held more frequently.
                </p>
                <p>Kava has been part of Tongan formal ceremony and social culture for more than 2000 years. The kava
                    is made from the root of Pepper Methysticum, a native pepper plant. The root is first pulled from the
                    ground and washed. The outer skin is then scraped revealing the creamy colored core that is pounded
                    into a powder form. A special carved bowl is used for mixing the kava drink. The amount of water
                    needed to accommodate the number of participants is poured into the bowl. The kava powder is then
                    stirred in. A strainer made from the tangled fibers of the wild hibiscus bark is used to strain the kava
                    and obtain the clearest liquid possible. The kava is served in a half coconut shell cup. Kava, though
                    nonalcoholic, contains a mild narcotic that induces a state of restfulness and well being. There are no
                    hangover effects from kava.

                </h3>
                <p>In Tongan society, this is the fale where women usually do their arts and crafts, such as tapa cloth
                    making. Tapa was used primarily for clothing and bedding. Today, however, tapa is used mostly at
                    ceremonial occasions for gift giving such a weddings or funerals and we also use it here in the islands
                    as dancing costumes.
                </p>
                <div class="image-left3">
                    <img src="images/TO4.png" alt="">
                    <p>Tapa cloth is made from inner bark of the paper
                        mulberry tree. Because the bark is naturally hard and
                        dry, it is first soaked in fresh water overnight prior to
                        working on it. Women then gather the soaked bark
                        and place it on a tutua or large flat log and begin to
                        pound it with an ike or wooden mallet. The inner
                        bark soon thins out to the point where holes begin to
                        appear. It takes about 45 minutes or more of
                        continuous pounding. The strips are then hung in the
                        sun to dry. A special glue obtained from half-boiled
                        tapioca is used to glue the strips lengthwise and
                        crosswise to make the tapa cloth.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Tapa varies from one Polynesian group to another.
                    Tongans call it ngatu. In Samoa it is called siapo.
                    Fijians call this cloth masi. In Hawai’i it is called kapa.
                    One way of distinguishing the various island types of
                    tapa is in the designs. To make the designs on the tapa
                    cloth, brown and black dyes are usually used. The
                    brown dye is obtained from the inner bark of the
                    candlenut tree (kukui).
                    Black dye is obtained by
                    boiling the brown dye
                    with red hibiscus leaves and flowers.</p>
                    <div class="image-left">
                        <p>Stencils (called kupesi in Tongan) are made from the mid ribs of the
                            coconut leaves, the threads are from the wild hibiscus bark and the
                            coconut fibers as the backing board. The stencil being placed under the
                            cloth and the brown dye is rubbed onto the cloth. The raised parts of the
                            stencil pick up more dye and so the designs and patterns stand out more
                            prominently on the cloth. Black dye is applied with natural pandanus
                            dried seed brushes after the cloth has dried which completes the intricate
                            designs. The black and brown dyes are permanent once they have dried.
                            These days, the Tongan people are some of the most active Polynesians in
                            preserving the traditional art of tapa-making. If you were to go to Tonga
                            today, you would likely hear the constant pounding of the ike or wooden
                            mallet against the tutua log as the women of Tonga worked to make their
                            prized tapa cloth.</p>

                    <p><strong>LALANGA:</strong>  (Weaving) The two plants that are important to the craft of weaving in Polynesia are
                        pandanus and coconuts trees. The pandanus leaves are favored for the weaving of the household items
                        such as floor mats, storage baskets, tablemats and fans. They were also used for canoe sails, bracelets
                        and footwear. These leaves were cut when they were still green and laid out to dry in direct sunlight.
                        After 2 weeks when the leaves are dried, they are twisted and hung for weeks. Then they are smoothed
                        out and rolled one after another into larger rolls of about a foot in diameter, and then they are secured,
                        stacked and stored for later use.</p>
                    <p id="peito">When the women are ready to use the leaves they are rubbed with a smooth shell until they are flat and
                        pliable. Then using a different shell they are cut according to their required width. The thinner the
                        strips the more important and valuable the project. The coconut leave is other important weaving
                        material in Polynesia. The leaves are cut right off the tree and utilized. Baskets, hats and bowls are
                        easily made because the leaves can be stripped off the main leaf. Coconut leaves provide an easy finish
                        off a house. They can be layered to make a roof, walls and used as screen out the wind and rain, or
                        made into mats used to line the floor over which fine mats would be used.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>The Fale Peito is the cooking hut and is usually build away from other buildings in the home because
                    of the smoke and flame while preparing and cooking of food. The underground oven or ‘umu is usually
                    started once a day in early morning. The main hot meal of the day is eaten at noon. Enough food is
                    cooked in the umu so that there is enough for the whole day. However, the cooks have learned proper
                    placement of various food items in the umu to assure that proper temperatures are maintained as closely
                    as possible for the best possible cooking of the food.</p>
                <p>The earth oven in Polynesian is the man’s domain because it is so physically demanding from the
                    beginning to the end. You must first dig a bowl-shaped pit, gather firewood preferably dried, good
                    burning twigs and branches and large rocks. The fire is started with dried coconut leaves and the dried
                    braches then the large firewood are placed into a sturdy flat shape. The rocks are then placed carefully
                    over the complete framework and the rocks are heated until they are grayish white in color. The
                    unburned woods are removed and the rocks are leveled to the bowl-shape again. The banana stumps
                    are then place on top of the hot rocks. The pit is then filled with food that had been prepared and then
                    covered them with a lot of banana leaves. The oven is totally covered with dirt to ensure that no steam
