                <p><strong>Current Population:</strong> 180,000-Tahiti (280,000- French Polynesia)</p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> Tahiti is located approximately 2,700 miles
                    (4,350 km) southeast of Hawaii or about half-way between South America and Australia.</p>
                <p><strong>Size:</strong> The combined land mass covers about 1,400 square miles (13,660 km²)</p>
                <p>The island of Tahiti, administrative center of French Polynesia, often represents all of the
                    116 surrounding tropical high rise islands and atolls in the Society Islands, Austral Islands,
                    Tuamotus, Gambier and Marquesas Islands.</p>
                <p><strong>Known:</strong> French Polynesia</p>
                <p><strong>Fact: </strong> Tahitian craftsmen sometimes bury newly carved wooden drumsticks in mud for
                    several years before using them to assure just the right degree of hardness and proper
                    tuning.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="parcenter">Welcome to the Island of Tahiti. Tahiti is just part of one of five island groups (the Society Islands, the
                    Marquesas Islands, the Austral Islands, the Tuamoutu Islands, and the Gambier Islands) that make up the
                    nation of French Polynesia which consists of a total of 116 islands. These islands are spread out over an ocean
                    area as large as the continent of Europe. French Polynesia is a semi-autonomous overseas territory of France,
                    with its own president, parliament and laws. France's influence is limited to subsidies, education and security.</p>
                <p class="parcenter">The first European discoverer of Tahiti was Captain Samuel Wallis of the British Royal Navy in 1767, although
                    Tahiti didn’t become very well-known in Europe until Wallis was followed by French Navigator Count Louis
                    de Bougainville (1768) who published Voyage autour du monde. In his book, Bougainville described the island as
                    an earthly paradise where men and women live happily in innocence, away from the corruption of civilization.
                </p>
                <p class="parcenter">The Tahitian population went into a period of decline in the 19th Century due largely to the introduction of new
                    diseases by Europeans to which the Tahitians had no natural immunity. In this century, however, the Tahitian
                    population has grown at a steady upward rate. The current population of all of French Polynesia is about
                    280,000, with 180,000 living on the island of Tahiti. An interesting statistic from French Polynesian today is that
                    more than half of the population is under the age of 20. The approximate racial breakdown of the Tahitian
                    population is 70% Polynesian, 12% European, 10% Polynesian/European, 5% Chinese, and 3%
                    Polynesian/Chinese. All are French citizens.</p>
                <img class="image" src="images/T1.png" alt="">
                <p class="parcenter">The first inhabitants of this area are believed to have arrived about in the islands around 830 A.D. Tahitians
                    remained isolated until the late 18th century when the British and French entered into a long series of political
                    maneuvers which lasted over 50 years. Finally, by 1842, the French were in full control, although formal French
                    rule had to wait until 1880, with the abdication of King Pomare V in favor of French rule. On July 14, 1977,
                    France granted Tahiti the right to be self-governing. Tahitians have been French citizens since 1946 and speak
                    the official languages, French and Tahitian.</p>
                <p  id="tai" class="parcenter">The primary resources of Tahiti, besides the key industry of tourism, are the products of the coconut   such as copra which is sun dried coconut meat, and refined coconut oil known as monoi which is used as skin care
                and suntan lotion. Secondary resources include mother of pearl shells, cultured pearls, fish, vanilla and more
                recently, the cultivation of the noni fruit for its health and nutritional properties.</p>

                <h2 class="TA">FARE TAUTAI: 
                    <p class="subtitle">Fisherman’s Hut</p>
                </h2>
                <p>A Tahitian family which lived near the sea would most probably have had a fishing hut made out of
                    bamboo lashed together. The roof is covered with bundled coconut leaves or with sugar cane leaves.
                    This hut would contain minimal furnishings. Sometimes it may have a bed, fish traps hanging from
                    special hooks, a bench or other types of seating, fishing poles, gourds used as containers, nets, ropes
                    and other equipment needed to catch fish efficiently.
                </p>
                <div class="image-tahiti">
                    <p>Tahitian fish traps were not actually used to
                        trap fish but to store them. The fish were
                        caught first whether by a’ira (line) or upe’a
                        (net) and then placed inside the bamboo trap
                        or ha’ape’e. The door was then closed and
                        the whole trap placed in the water and kept
                        halfway afloat using floats attached on either
                        side. Floats were carved out of burau (balsa)
                        or wild hibiscus wood.</p>
                    <img src="images/T2.png" alt="">
                </div>
                <p> Thus the fish are kept
                    alive so whenever fresh fish is needed, they
                    are readily available in the bamboo trap. Each night the fisherman brings all his nets,
                    nape or taura (ropes), auri patia i’a (fishing
                    spears), traps, and other equipment inside his
                    shed for repair and safekeeping. 
                </p>
                <p>The next morning, he is ready to start a new day of tai’a or fishing.
                    From small sheds such as this, fishermen wait for the right time to go fishing, while contemplating the
                    beauty of their islands, or chatting with a friend, or watching over their pearl crop.</p>
                <div class="image-tahiti">
                    <img src="images/T3.png" alt="">
                    <p>Diving for mother pearls, an ancient and high risk method practiced by the people of the Tuamotu to
                        obtain, on rare occasions, a black pearl
                        from a mother pearl, has quickly
                        become a thing of the past since the
                        introduction of black pearl farming by
                        Japanese experts in the late 70's.</p>
                </div>
                <p> With
                    the aid of modern technology and a
                    new method of farming the mother
                    pearl, this dying source of industry was
                    quickly revived as the black pearl
                    business began to boom throughout
                    the Tuamotu islands.</p>
                <p id="iva">Fortunately, due to the lack of
                    pollution in Tahitian waters and the
                    perfect temperature of the blue
                    lagoons, the black pearls have since
                    then been considered to be the most beautiful poe rava or black pearls in the world. As such, it has
                    rapidly ranked as one of French Polynesia’s highest resource of industry, second only to tourism.

                    <p class="subtitle">Place of Celebration</p>
                </h2>
                <p>This tahua orira’a or traditional dance platform is elevated for better viewing of the special daily
                    programs which take place here. The songs and dances of Tahiti which you will see here will be
                    performed in their native language. All Tahitians also speak French which is taught to them once they
                    enter school. The tradition of entertainment in Tahiti once centered on a special guild of traveling
                    performers called the arioi. They sailed on great double canoes from bay to bay and island to island
                    performing dance, pantomime dramas, and chants honoring the god Oro, deity of peace, agriculture
                    and fertility.
                </p>
                <p>The Tahitian islanders in this village will demonstrate the pa’oti and tamure, the graceful yet energetic
                    hip-shaking dance which young and old perform throughout the islands. One of the most widely
                    recognized images of the islands is the world famous Tahitian tamure, often confused with Hawaiian
                    Hula. This dance, easily recognized by its "fast hip-shaking," and "grass skirts" (see below for actual
                    material used to make these skirts) is often confused with the Hawaiian Hula, a generally slower dance
                    which focuses more on the hands and story telling than the hips.
                </p>
                <img class="image" src="images/T4.png" alt="">
                <p>The compelling rhythm of the dance is provided by the to’ere or a horizontal slit-gong wooden drum,
                    and the fa’atete or upright wooden drum similar to the snare drum but covered with goat or shark skin.
                    The pahu tupa’i, beaten by hands, and the tari parau beaten with drumsticks, are drums made from the
                    cow hide or sharkskin.</p>
                <div class="image-tahiti1">
                    <img src="images/T5.png" alt="">
                    <p>Some of the dances or songs will feature the more modern
                        instruments such as the guitar and a special version of the ukulele,
                        popularly known as the Tahitian banjo, which have become vitally
                        important to our music, since their introduction by European settlers.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Tahitian dancing skirts are not made of grass. Dancing skirts in Tahiti are made out
                    of the inner fiber of the fau, or wild hibiscus tree. The women strip off the outer bark of the hibiscus and soak
                    the remaining branches in water. They then strip off the inner bark and dry it in the sun. After the silky inner
                    bark is dried, it is shredded into very narrow strips. The strips are bundled into small clumps and tied onto a
                    waistband also made of the strips. Skirts worn by women for dancing can weigh as much as seven or eight
                    pounds. The dancers find that the heavier the skirt, the better it sways when they move their hips in the fast-
                    shaking</p>
                <img class="image" src="images/T6.png" alt="">
                <p>Tassels and shells are placed on the waistband for decoration as well as to accentuate the movement of
                    the hips. In addition, the weighty waistband helps to weigh down the skirts to prevent them from
                    slipping off during the aggressive dancing. Women’s skirts extend down to the ankles, while men’s
                    skirts extend just below the knees. On festive occasions, dancers try to wear the most elaborately
                    decorated dancing outfits.</p>
                <p id="pote">When making shell leis many shells of the same size must be individually punched with a sharp rock
                    to create small holes. The shells are then strung together in intricate methods. Anciently, sennit or
                    purau (wild hibiscus fiber) was used to string the shells together. Today, modern nylon proves to be
                    more durable.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>This chief’s dwelling represents the round-ended style of Tahitian architecture reserved usually for
                    Chiefs and Nobles. The larger this type of house is, the higher the rank of the owner. The important
                    furnishings would include many large finely woven mats, the noho ra’a or four-legged wooden seats
                    for high ranking individuals, the turu’a or wooden headrest, and an elevated bed.
                </p>
                <p>There were 3 parts to a chiefly bed: first a layer of dried banana leaves, secondly a layer of mats piled
                    on top of one another for softness, and thirdly a coverlet or blanket which originally were made of
                    woven lauhala leaves. Today, quilts are favored because they are easier to maintain.
                </p>
                <p>Other personal effects which might be found in a noble dwelling include costumes, small boxes of
                    highly valued red feathers, drums, flowers, and tiki carvings. Tikis are designed and placed to ward
                    off evil spirits. The largest tikis are usually located on the marae or temple enclosures.
                </p>
                <p>The wives of the early Christian missionaries in Tahiti taught Tahitian women the art of quilting which
                    is called tifaifai. Tahitian quilting differs from the Hawaiian version in that they do not pad their quilts
                    with batting, nor do they sew the three layers together. Their quilts have only an applique or pieced-
                    together front which is backed with a complimentary backing.
                </p>
                <p>The design of Tahitian quilts also differs from Hawaiian quilts in that Tahitians favor either large boldly-
                    colored overall designs which they applique, or piece together intricate patchwork designs using tiny
                    cutouts of colored cloth. On very special occasions of celebration, the treasured quilts they have
                    carefully stored are brought out and displayed for all to enjoy.

                </h2>
                <p>Anciently, the Marae were built specifically for High Chiefs as a symbol of their power and authority.
                    Coronations & other important events such as war councils, peace treaties, victory celebrations and
                    voyage preparations, took place there. The Marae was usually a large rectangular area surrounded by
                    a stone wall, and guarded by tikis to discourage entries by the uninvited.
                </p>
                <p>These human like figures carved in basalt, volcanic tuff, or wood are usually found near a marae or
                    other holy places. Experts believe tikis had religious significance and symbolized Gods and/or
                    deceased ancestors. Well preserved Tikis are found throughout Polynesia, particularly in the
                    Marquesas Islands, the largest being 9 feet tall. A fear of evil or bad luck coming to individuals who disturb tikis may influence some natives. More
                    likely, the hope that tikis should be protected so future generations can view them, explains the
                    respect for tiki’s shown by most islanders.</p>

                <p>The Priest or Tahu’a, was responsible for the clan’s sacred activities which include prayers, and other

                <p>As an important member of the clan aristocracy, the Priest was assisted by lesser officiators called

                    layers of flat stones, is reserved as seating for the Priest and Royalty during ceremonies, and is
                    therefore considered to be the most holy place on the Marae.</p>
                <p>Since the European era, once a year, the opening ceremony of the Heiva Nui i Tahiti, considered to be
                    one of the top-three worldwide Polynesian Cultural Events, takes place on the Marae Arahurahu,
                    located on the western side of the Island of Tahiti, with the re-enactment of various stages of a Chief’s
                    coronation ceremony. However, smaller Maraes were constructed by ancient Polynesian families or
                    clans, to celebrate other sacred traditions.</p>
                <p>The Polynesian Cultural Center is proud to present our very own Tahitian Marae built by and under
                    the direction of Archeologist Mr. Joseph Tchong, (a native from Tahiti who has been actively engaged
                    in the renovation of other significant Maraes throughout French Poynesia), and approved by the
                    Minister of Cultures of French Polynesia who was officially represented by Mr. Heremoana
                    Maamaatuaiahutapu, Director of the House of Culture and the Office of Tourism, in the
                    groundbreaking and dedication of this marae for the common purpose of preserving & sharing with
                    the world, Tahiti’s ancient & sacred traditions, such as the celebration of births, marriages & deaths,
                    just to name a few.</p>
                <p>This priceless work of art, gifted from “Te Fare Tauhiti Nui” and the “Association of Papenoo
                    Marae Preservation” to the Polynesian Cultural Center, was built with 3,200 river stones that have
                    been carefully handpicked one by one from the rivers deep in the beautiful valley of Papenoo Tahiti,
                    and shipped here to Hawaii, a process that took nearly a year.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Cooking Hut</p>
                </h2>
                <p>This open structure is an example of a Tahitian cooking house. Each Tahitian family would have an
                    outdoor kitchen like this located where the smoke would not interfere with the main house. Both men
                    and women shared in the cooking chores. A man would typically gather the vegetables, hunt pigs and
                    birds, fish in the deeper waters, and perform the more strenuous cooking chores. Women’s
                    responsibilities include food preparation and assisting the men in making the underground oven.</p>
                <p>The earth oven in Tahiti is called ahima’a which is prepared once a day around mid-morning. Several
                    volcanic rocks are first heated in a roaring fire. When the rocks are glowing and red hot, the firewood
                    debris is removed leaving the rocks for the actual cooking. A layer of banana stump fibers which have
                    been pounded into a stringy mass is placed immediately on the hot rocks.
                </p>
                <p>Next, the food to feed the family for a day is wrapped in a variety of leaves and placed on the banana
                    fiber layer. Vegetables like breadfruit, taro, umara, ufi and green bananas are scraped and peeled and
                    placed naturally on the rocks among the other food items.
                </p>
                <p id="noni">The final layers consist of broad leaves, specially-woven mats made from the leaves of the wild hibiscus
                    tree, or green banana leaves, or old mats, used to seal in the heat until the food is cooked. Traditionally,
                    the dirt or sand dug from the pit is spaded on top of everything to ensure the best results.</p>

                    <p class="subtitle">Indian Mulberry Tree</p>
                </h2>
                <p>The Indian Mulberry, or Noni, as it is called in Hawaii and Tahiti, grows well on sandy or rocky
                    shores. Apart from saline conditions, the plant also can withstand drought and grows in secondary
                    soils. Thus the noni tree can be seen in clearings, volcanic terrain, lava-strewn coasts and on limestone
                    outcrops.</p>
                    <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                        <li><strong>USE AS FOOD:</strong> The fruits are edible, but have a strong pungent smell and taste, so for the
                            most part, they were eaten as a famine food. In some Pacific islands, like Raratonga &
                            Kiribati, the fruit was used as a staple food of choice, where they were cooked into curries and
                            stews. Elsewhere, the fruit is eaten raw with salt (Indochina, Australian Aborigines). The
                            fruits may also be fed to pig livestock. The young leaves can also be eaten as a vegetable and
                            contain protein (4-6%). Seeds may be roasted and eaten.

                        <br>
                        <li><strong>OTHER USES: </strong> The bark of the noni produces a reddish purple and brown dye. In Hawaii, a
                            yellowish dye was also extracted from the roots and also used to dye cloth. The tree was also
                            purposely planted to provide support for pepper vines and shade tree or wind-breaker for
                            coffee bushes.

                                    found evidence that some noni properties can help to control diseases like diabetes
